AP PhotoGiovanna DellOrto MINNEAPOLIS AP  Right after Sunday worship at St. Pauls-San Pablo Lutheran Church, Juan Carlos Toapanta lay in a lounge chair set up by the altar, needles sticking out of his forehead, wrist and foot for an hourlong acupuncture session. Just like the Lords light helps emotionally, the bodys pain is treated as well, said the Ecuadorian construction worker, who suffers from sciatica and has worshipped at the Minneapolis church for about five months. Everything feels freed, emotionally. Founded by Swedish immigrants in the late 19th century, the church is now a predominantly Latino congregation. Like most other churches in the U.S. that serve migrants, it has expanded its humanitarian, financial, legal and pastoral ministries during the Trump administrations immigration crackdown. It has also added monthly well-being sessions  at no charge  with acupuncture, Reiki and cupping therapy to ease the stress that uncertainty and fear have sown among the migrant community  including people in the U.S. illegally and U.S.-born citizens in mixed-status families. We have to feel well to respond well, not with panic and fear, which leads to nothing good, said Lizete Vega, the churchs family engagement coordinator. People here feel that theyre protected and can be cared for spiritually, emotionally and physically. Faith leaders have increasingly found themselves called to help their congregations with mental health concerns, from chaplains in the U.S. Navy to pastors in the rural heartland. Some see the need to provide reassurance and well-being as a growing part of their ministry to migrants, even as revised federal immigration guidelines now provide more leeway for enforcement in or near houses of worship. It was as if they were able to exhale a big breath, the Rev. Hierald Osorto said of the 30 congregants who signed up for the first well-being session in March at St. Pauls, where an outdoor mural features two traditional Swedish Dala horses between the Spanish words sanación healing and resiliencia resilience. After last Sundays worship, the altar table and Easter lilies were moved to make room for seven acupuncture chairs, arranged in a circle facing the central cross. Three massage tables were set up in front of the pews for the Reiki treatment, where practitioners hold their hands on or near the bodys energy centers. To see this space be quite literally a place of healing, in the place where we talk about it right at the altar, it moved me to tears, Osorto said. Wellness practitioners and mental health clinicians say anxiety and depression among those they serve in migrant communities have spread and intensified this year. Already, migrants often arrive with severe trauma from violence they fled in their home countries as well as attacks along cartel-controlled routes to and through the U.S. border. Women in particular often suffer sexual violence on the journey. For many, the fear that they or someone in their families might be deported is revictimizing. That makes it imperative that safe places exist where they can focus on wellness, said Noeline Maldonado, executive director of The Healing Center, which helps domestic and sexual violence victims in Brooklyn, New York. Sessions that promote grounding and mindfulness are necessary to cope with the stress of both immediate crises as well as long-term unpredictability as immigration policies shift. Uncertainty is the biggest thing, said Cheryl Aguilar, director of Hope Center for Wellness in the Washington, D.C., area, which has partnered with churches to provide mental health programs. Being in community and cultivating hope is crucial because many people are responding to fear with rising anxiety, traumatic symptoms and isolation, all of which can have lasting consequences, Aguilar added. Its nonstop work, nonstop fear, said Sarah Howell, a clinical social worker in Houston with more than a decade of experience in migration-related trauma. Every issue seems bigger. Howell said many of her clients in Texas are realizing they cant live in a state of constant alarm, and the respite that wellness programs can bring becomes essential. People feel hopeless, but they have to keep fighting, said Guadalupe Gonzalez, one of the bilingual Reiki practitioners whose organization, Odigo Wellness, partnered with St. Pauls in Minneapolis to offer the sessions. She said she had some doubts about offering these healing practices inside a church  a large space with light flooding in and people moving through. But the sanctuary has a very nice, very positive energy, Gonzalez said. As practitioners we feel a lot of emotions. Several congregants who attended last Sundays two-hour wellness session said they felt both the energy and the connection between these healing practices and faith. Martha Dominguez came bouncing down the altar steps after an acupuncture session. Grinning, she said she had never imagined a church would offer these kinds of benefits. Yes, it helps so much, said the Mexican immigrant. It takes the stress away from you. Limber Saliero, a roofer from Ecuador who has been worshipping at St. Pauls for more than a year, said he had never heard of acupuncture but decided to try it. I felt like an energy that was flowing into me, he said. Vanessa Arcos tried acupuncture with her sister and her father, while her mother got a Reiki treatment. The family started attending the church the week they arrived in Minnesota from their home state of Guerrero, Mexico, almost a decade ago. Lying in the lounge chair next to a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Arcos said she overcame her fear of needles and found the treatment relaxing for both muscles and mind. It felt very peaceful, very safe, Arcos said. Its important to do little things for yourself. ___ This story has been updated to correct Lizete Vegas job title to family engagement coordinator instead of its Latino outreach coordinator. It has also been corrected to reflect that Limber Saliero has worshipped at St. Pauls for more than a year, instead of five years. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

"Title: In the rapidly shifting world of work, many employees are unclear whats expected of them
Description: More workers have reported feeling disconnected from their organizations purpose and unclear on how to meet expectations since the coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work.
Content: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. AP Illustration  Annie Ng NEW YORK AP  When Nikelle Inman started a new job coaching first-generation college students, she looked forward to meeting with them one-on-one to talk about how to surmount obstacles and find resources to succeed. Instead, she and her fellow success coaches at a community college in North Carolina spent a year mired in paperwork, tasked with reviewing applications from aspiring undergraduates. They never did get to meet with students. Admissions work kind of took over what we were supposed to do, Inman, 34, said. I felt disengaged with the position, more so because I just didnt feel valued. Its disorienting when a job turns out to be completely different than advertised or morphs into something we didnt expect. But more U.S. workers have reported feeling disconnected from their organizations purpose and unclear on how to meet expectations since the coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work, according to a new Gallup analysis. Just under half of U.S. employees who participated in a Gallup survey in November strongly agreed that they know what is expected of them at work, which is one of the factors the polling firm uses to measure employee engagement. In January 2020, the figure stood at 56. The new survey showed that new employees, younger employees, people in white-collar industries like technology, insurance and finance, and those in hybrid work arrangements were especially likely to report that expectations for their roles werent clear. This article is part of APs Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. The findings make intuitive sense. Managers and employees have bushwhacked their way through disruptive changes since COVID-19 first upended public life five years ago. In late 2024, about one-quarter of employees with the ability to work remotely were doing so exclusively, up from around 1 in 10 in 2019, Gallup found. Another 55 were working in the office some days and remotely the rest, according to the 2024 data, up from about one-third in 2019. More recently, layoffs at tech companies and in the government and other sectors have left organizations with fewer people to handle the load, and expectations arent always adjusted to the new realities. With all the rounds of layoffs, peoples scope and responsibilities are shifting constantly, said Jeremy Guttenplan, an executive leadership trainer and coach based in New York. You think about the ones left behind and the work is just getting piled on them. Here are some strategies for eliminating confusion when the scope and responsibilities of a job are ambiguous. Spell out or make sure you understand what a new role or project entails  along with any relevant deadlines or performance markers  from the beginning so everyone agrees on whats realistic and wanted. Writing it down in a shared document can help prevent future misunderstandings. When a successful real estate developer asked Amber Krasinski to film and produce 85 TikTok videos in three hours, she thought hard about whether she really wanted to take him on as a client. The job might be good exposure for her communications agency, IvyHill Stategies, but Krasinski knew it would be impossible to complete in so little time. She turned it down. Krasinski regularly gives her client progress updates and tries to make a practice of asking clarifying questions before taking on new projects. Any time I have a conversation with a prospective client, I have that in the back of my mind, Krasinski said. Avoiding that people-pleasing side that says, You can figure it out, you can do it. You dont want to let anybody down, but you also need to set yourself up for success. No one wants to spend all day in meetings. But more frequent check-ins with a manager or supervisor may help staff members who are unsure if they are prioritizing their time appropriately or dont know what they are supposed to be doing. Organizations can explore different ways of building connection between employees and providing more opportunities for feedback, which can result in better understanding of workplace expectations. Brian Smith, founder and managing partner of IA Business Advisors, said his company hosts gratitude sessions for 30 minutes each week. The first 20 minutes are led by a coach who advises attendees on issues such as how to effectively manage time or deal with challenging customers. Highlighting specific problems and strategies can help workers understand whats expected of them. At the end of the session, participants have an opportunity to share what theyre grateful for. Workers dont have to wait for a supervisor to seek feedback or clarify expectations. You can suggest a quick check-in at any point, if youre unsure how to prioritize long-term goals or short-term deadlines, Managing upwards is going to make your life easier, said Dale Whelehan, founder of 4 Day World, a think tank that explores new models of work. Dont assume that management has all the answers. Theyre probably just as lost. However, in hierarchical organizations where questioning management may be viewed negatively, its important to be delicate, he said. To initiate a feedback discussion, you can ask to meet with a manager about a current project. Whelehan outlined how to approach the conversation if the meeting gets scheduled. Start by sharing what you understand your assignment to be. Then request the managers confirmation or clarification by saying something such as, I just want to make sure that theres alignment here, he advised. Ask about anything else you need to clarify and close out the conversation by saying, From what I understand from this conversation, my role is this. ... Have I understood that correctly? Follow up with an email restating what you agreed to, Whelehan said. With workplaces experiencing so many changes, employees can find themselves jumping from one assignment to the other, distracted by new responsibilities picked up after colleagues were laid off, or adjusting to spending more time physically in the office. If it all feels too chaotic, take a moment to pause. Revisit your priorities. And then work on the most important task. If something doesnt feel right, dont just accept it, Inman said. Whatever that avenue is, if its staying and trying to make it better or leaving, just dont give up on what you know is right. ____ Have you overcome an obstacle or made a profound change in your work?

Stefan RousseauPool Foto vía AP KIEV, Ucrania AP  En una muestra de unidad en Kiev el sábado, los dirigentes de cuatro importantes países europeos amenazaron con aumentar la presión si el presidente ruso Vladímir Putin no acepta un cese del fuego incondicional de 30 días. Los mandatarios de Francia, el Reino Unido, Alemania y Polonia dijeron que la propuesta de iniciar el cese del fuego el lunes cuenta con el apoyo del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, a quien habían informado por teléfono más temprano ese día. Su declaración se produjo en medio de crecientes esfuerzos para persuadir a Moscú de aceptar una tregua que permitiría conversaciones de paz para poner fin a más de tres años de guerra a gran escala. La exigencia fue anunciada en una conferencia de prensa conjunta con el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyy y los países que lideran la llamada coalición de los dispuestos un grupo de más de 30 países que se han comprometido a fortalecer a Ucrania para disuadir la agresión rusa. Entre ellos se encontraban el presidente francés Emmanuel Macron, el primer ministro británico Keir Starmer, el canciller alemán Friedrich Merz y el primer ministro polaco Donald Tusk, quienes viajaron el sábado juntos a Ucrania por primera vez. El cese del fuego incluiría un alto a los combates en tierra, mar y aire. Los líderes amenazaron con aumentar las sanciones, incluidas las del sector energético y bancario de Rusia, si Putin no cumple. Horas antes, el ministro de Asuntos Exteriores de Ucrania, Andrii Sybiha, dijo que Kiev y sus aliados están listos para un cese del fuego completo e incondicional con Rusia durante al menos 30 días a partir del lunes. Agregó que los cuatro líderes visitantes y Zelenskyy habían tenido una llamada telefónica constructiva con Trump. El sábado fue el último día del cese del fuego unilateral de tres días declarado por Rusia, que, según Ucrania, las fuerzas del Kremlin han violado repetidamente. En marzo, Estados Unidos propuso una tregua inmediata y limitada de 30 días, que Ucrania aceptó, pero el Kremlin ha insistido en términos que le sean más favorables. Fortalecer las capacidades militares de Ucrania será un elemento clave para disuadir a Rusia , dijeron el sábado los líderes europeos. Esto requerirá suministrar a Ucrania cantidades robustas de armas para disuadir futuros ataques e invertir en su sector de defensa. Una fuerza compuesta por tropas extranjeras también podría desplegarse como una medida adicional de tranquilidad, dijo Macron. El presidente francés agregó que Estados Unidos tomará la delantera en la supervisión de un cese del fuego propuesto, con el apoyo de países europeos, y amenazó con sanciones masivas... preparadas y coordinadas entre europeos y estadounidenses, si Rusia viola la tregua. Pero dijo que los detalles sobre posibles despliegues europeos en Ucrania aún se están afinando. No se mencionó la membresía en la OTAN, que sigue siendo la principal opción de Kiev para una garantía de seguridad. La prioridad es hacer que la guerra sea demasiado costosa para que Rusia continúe luchando, dijo Sybiha a los reporteros al margen del evento. El teniente general retirado Keith Kellogg, enviado especial de Trump para Ucrania y Rusia, dijo el sábado que un cese del fuego integral de 30 días, que cubra ataques desde el aire, tierra, mar y sobre infraestructura, iniciará el proceso para poner fin a la guerra más grande y larga en Europa desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Más temprano el sábado, los líderes europeos se unieron a una ceremonia en la Plaza de la Independencia de Kiev para conmemorar el 80mo aniversario del final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Encendieron velas junto a Zelenskyy en un memorial improvisado con banderas en honor a los soldados ucranianos caídos y a los civiles asesinados desde la invasión rusa. Trump ha presionado a ambas partes para llegar rápidamente a un acuerdo para poner fin a la guerra, pero mientras Zelenskyy aceptó el plan estadounidense para una pausa inicial de 30 días en las hostilidades, Rusia no ha firmado. En cambio, ha seguido lanzando ataques a lo largo de los aproximadamente 1.600 kilómetros 1.000 millas del frente, incluyendo operaciones letales en zonas residenciales sin objetivos militares evidentes. El sábado por la mañana, funcionarios de la región de Sumy, en el norte de Ucrania, reportaron que los bombardeos rusos de la víspera mataron a tres residentes e hirieron a otros cuatro. Otro civil murió en el acto el sábado cuando un dron ruso alcanzó la ciudad sureña de Jersón, según el gobernador regional, Oleksandr Prokudin. Hablando con reporteros en Kiev, el presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron, dijo Lo que está sucediendo con Polonia, Alemania y el Reino Unido es un momento histórico para la defensa europea y hacia una mayor independencia para nuestra seguridad. Obviamente para Ucrania, pero también para todos nosotros. Es una nueva era. Es una Europa que se ve a sí misma como una potencia. La semana pasada, Trump señaló que duda que el presidente de Rusia, Vladímir Putin, quiera poner fin a su guerra en Ucrania, expresando un nuevo escepticismo de que se pueda alcanzar un acuerdo de paz pronto, y sugirió más sanciones contra Rusia. El progreso para poner fin a la guerra ha parecido esquivo en los meses desde que Trump regresó a la Casa Blanca, y sus afirmaciones anteriores de avances inminentes no se han materializado. Trump ha presionado en el pasado a Ucrania para ceder territorio a Rusia y poner fin a la guerra, y amenazó con retirarse si el acuerdo se complica, lo que ha hecho sonar las alarmas en Europa acerca de cómo llenar ese vacío. Los aliados europeos de Ucrania ven la guerra como fundamental para la seguridad del continente, por lo que se ha incrementado la presión para encontrar formas de respaldar militarmente a Kiev, con independencia de que la Casa Blanca se retire. ___ El periodista de The Associated Press Thomas Adamson en París contribuyó a este despacho. ___ Esta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.

Rhianna ChadwickPA via AP Chelsea became the first team to complete an undefeated 22-game campaign in the Womens Super League after beating Liverpool 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in the final round on Saturday. Already crowned champion for a sixth straight year, Chelsea finished with 60 points  12 more than second-place Arsenal  after 19 wins and three draws. After a stoppage-time goal by Aggie Beever-Jones clinched victory over Liverpool, Chelsea captain Millie Bright lifted the trophy to a backdrop of fireworks. Other teams have gone through a full top-flight campaign unbeaten in womens soccer but not since the league was expanded to 12 teams  with 22 games in the season  in 2019-20. Sonia Bompastor, in her first season as Chelsea coach, said it was a really great achievement by her big-spending club. Every game was tough, even though for some people that is difficult to believe, she said, but even today we find the goal in the last minute to win. Chelsea won the Womens League Cup in March and is into the Womens FA Cup final against Manchester United on May 18 in a bid to secure the domestic treble. The teams only losses in all competitions this season were in both legs against Barcelona in the Womens Champions League semifinals. Chelsea, Arsenal and third-place Manchester United will be Englands representatives in the Womens Champions League next season.

Qiong Wu via AP This illustration provided by Xiaoran Zuo in March 2025 depicts an ancient parasitic wasp found in Myanmar that may have seized prey with its Venus flytrap-like back end. Xiaoran Zuo via AP NEW YORK AP  An ancient wasp may have zipped among the dinosaurs, with a body like a Venus flytrap to seize and snatch its prey, scientists reported Wednesday. The parasitic wasps abdomen boasts a set of flappy paddles lined with thin bristles, resembling a small bear trap attached to the end of it, said study co-author Lars Vilhelmsen from the Natural History Museum of Denmark. Scientists uncovered over a dozen female wasps preserved in 99-million-year-old amber from the Kachin region in northern Myanmar. The wasps flaps and teeth-like hairs resemble the structure of the carnivorous Venus flytrap plant, which snaps shut to digest unsuspecting insects. But the design of the wasps getup made scientists think its trap was designed to cushion, not crush. Instead, researchers suggested the flytrap-like structure was used to hold a wriggly insect still while the wasp laid an egg, depositing a baby wasp to feed on and drain its new host. Its a playbook adapted by many parasitic wasps, including modern-day cuckoo and bethylid wasps, to exploit insects. But no known wasp or any other insect does so with bizarre flaps quite like this one. Ive seen a lot of strange insects, but this has to be one of the most peculiar-looking ones Ive seen in a while, said entomologist Lynn Kimsey from the University of California, Davis, who was not involved with the research. Scientists named the new wasp Sirenobethylus charybdis, partly for the sea monster from Greek mythology that stirred up wild whirlpools by swallowing and expelling water. The new study was published in the journal BMC Biology and included researchers from Capital Normal University and the Beijing Xiachong Amber Museum in China. Its unclear when the wasp went extinct. Studying unusual insects like this one can help scientists understand what insects are capable of and how different they can be. We tend to think that the cool things are only found today, said Gabriel Melo, a wasp expert at the Federal University of Paraná in Brazil, who had no role in the study. But when we have this opportunity, we see that many really exceptional, odd things already happened. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

AP PhotoChutima Lalit Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles 1,300 kilometers away. Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed. Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earths surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.

The Myanmar Military True News Information Team via AP The Earths crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. This formation is mostly stable, but along the edges they are moving, Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said. Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing very slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump, triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.

Min Aung Hlaing, center, inspects damaged road caused by an earthquake Friday, March 28, 2025, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. The Myanmar Military True News Information Team via AP Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region. Earthquakes that occur in the ocean dont always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings. Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, but we cant predict when theyll occur, USGS seismologist Will Yeck said. However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely. Aftershocks are triggered because of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock, Yeck said. Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, you will probably see aftershocks for the next several months, Steckler said. People who evacuated from buildings following earthquake in Bangkok, Thailand, Friday, March 28, 2025. AP PhotoChutima Lalit In regions of the world with known active fault lines, including California and Japan, building codes are often designed to withstand earthquakes. But thats not true everywhere. If you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world, Yeck said. In many countries, including the United States, if youre inside when an earthquake occurs, its advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head  for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure  and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and dont use building elevators. If youre outside, try to remain in an area away from buildings or trees that could fall. Depending on the location, there may be secondary hazards triggered by earthquakes, such as landslides, fires or tsunamis, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

AP PhotoGiovanna DellOrto MINNEAPOLIS AP  Right after Sunday worship at St. Pauls-San Pablo Lutheran Church, Juan Carlos Toapanta lay in a lounge chair set up by the altar, needles sticking out of his forehead, wrist and foot for an hourlong acupuncture session. Just like the Lords light helps emotionally, the bodys pain is treated as well, said the Ecuadorian construction worker, who suffers from sciatica and has worshipped at the Minneapolis church for about five months. Everything feels freed, emotionally. Founded by Swedish immigrants in the late 19th century, the church is now a predominantly Latino congregation. Like most other churches in the U.S. that serve migrants, it has expanded its humanitarian, financial, legal and pastoral ministries during the Trump administrations immigration crackdown. It has also added monthly well-being sessions  at no charge  with acupuncture, Reiki and cupping therapy to ease the stress that uncertainty and fear have sown among the migrant community  including people in the U.S. illegally and U.S.-born citizens in mixed-status families. We have to feel well to respond well, not with panic and fear, which leads to nothing good, said Lizete Vega, the churchs family engagement coordinator. People here feel that theyre protected and can be cared for spiritually, emotionally and physically. Faith leaders have increasingly found themselves called to help their congregations with mental health concerns, from chaplains in the U.S. Navy to pastors in the rural heartland. Some see the need to provide reassurance and well-being as a growing part of their ministry to migrants, even as revised federal immigration guidelines now provide more leeway for enforcement in or near houses of worship. It was as if they were able to exhale a big breath, the Rev. Hierald Osorto said of the 30 congregants who signed up for the first well-being session in March at St. Pauls, where an outdoor mural features two traditional Swedish Dala horses between the Spanish words sanación healing and resiliencia resilience. After last Sundays worship, the altar table and Easter lilies were moved to make room for seven acupuncture chairs, arranged in a circle facing the central cross. Three massage tables were set up in front of the pews for the Reiki treatment, where practitioners hold their hands on or near the bodys energy centers. To see this space be quite literally a place of healing, in the place where we talk about it right at the altar, it moved me to tears, Osorto said. Wellness practitioners and mental health clinicians say anxiety and depression among those they serve in migrant communities have spread and intensified this year. Already, migrants often arrive with severe trauma from violence they fled in their home countries as well as attacks along cartel-controlled routes to and through the U.S. border. Women in particular often suffer sexual violence on the journey. For many, the fear that they or someone in their families might be deported is revictimizing. That makes it imperative that safe places exist where they can focus on wellness, said Noeline Maldonado, executive director of The Healing Center, which helps domestic and sexual violence victims in Brooklyn, New York. Sessions that promote grounding and mindfulness are necessary to cope with the stress of both immediate crises as well as long-term unpredictability as immigration policies shift. Uncertainty is the biggest thing, said Cheryl Aguilar, director of Hope Center for Wellness in the Washington, D.C., area, which has partnered with churches to provide mental health programs. Being in community and cultivating hope is crucial because many people are responding to fear with rising anxiety, traumatic symptoms and isolation, all of which can have lasting consequences, Aguilar added. Its nonstop work, nonstop fear, said Sarah Howell, a clinical social worker in Houston with more than a decade of experience in migration-related trauma. Every issue seems bigger. Howell said many of her clients in Texas are realizing they cant live in a state of constant alarm, and the respite that wellness programs can bring becomes essential. People feel hopeless, but they have to keep fighting, said Guadalupe Gonzalez, one of the bilingual Reiki practitioners whose organization, Odigo Wellness, partnered with St. Pauls in Minneapolis to offer the sessions. She said she had some doubts about offering these healing practices inside a church  a large space with light flooding in and people moving through. But the sanctuary has a very nice, very positive energy, Gonzalez said. As practitioners we feel a lot of emotions. Several congregants who attended last Sundays two-hour wellness session said they felt both the energy and the connection between these healing practices and faith. Martha Dominguez came bouncing down the altar steps after an acupuncture session. Grinning, she said she had never imagined a church would offer these kinds of benefits. Yes, it helps so much, said the Mexican immigrant. It takes the stress away from you. Limber Saliero, a roofer from Ecuador who has been worshipping at St. Pauls for more than a year, said he had never heard of acupuncture but decided to try it. I felt like an energy that was flowing into me, he said. Vanessa Arcos tried acupuncture with her sister and her father, while her mother got a Reiki treatment. The family started attending the church the week they arrived in Minnesota from their home state of Guerrero, Mexico, almost a decade ago. Lying in the lounge chair next to a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Arcos said she overcame her fear of needles and found the treatment relaxing for both muscles and mind. It felt very peaceful, very safe, Arcos said. Its important to do little things for yourself. ___ This story has been updated to correct Lizete Vegas job title to family engagement coordinator instead of its Latino outreach coordinator.

"Title: Snakes have bitten this man hundreds of times. His blood could help make a better treatment
Description: A Wisconsin man has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times, and scientists are studying his blood to treat snakebite.
Content: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. In a new study published Friday in the journal Cell, scientists created one antivenom to treat snakebites from several different species in mice  using antibodies from Tim Friedes blood. A more universal antivenom for humans is still many years away. NEW YORK AP  Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times  often on purpose. Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites. Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions and spiders venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home. Hoping to protect himself from snake bites  and out of what he calls simple curiosity  he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him. At first, it was very scary, Friede said. But the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it. In this photo provided by Centivax, Tim Friede, center, stands in a lab in South San Francisco, Calif., in 2023, that is using his blood to prepare an antivenom to the bites of various snakes. Centivax via AP While no doctor or emergency medical technician  or anyone, really  would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If its a small amount of venom the body can react before its overwhelmed. And if its venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures. Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites. I wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where Im just basically teetering right there and then back off of it, he said. But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance hed built up. And there is a need Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins. This photo provided by Centivax shows Mark Bellin and Hannah Hirou who are involved in efforts to produce an antivenom to counteract the bites of various snakes, at a lab in South San Francisco, Calif., in 2025. Centivax via AP When Columbia Universitys Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, Oh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years. In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friedes unique blood They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection. Its very early research  the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, its not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers. Despite the promise, there is much work to do, said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study. Friedes journey has not been without its missteps. Among them He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital. Friede is now employed by Centivax, a company trying to develop the treatment and that helped pay for the study. Hes excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite, but his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is simple Dont do it, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Title: In the rapidly shifting world of work, many employees are unclear whats expected of them
Description: More workers have reported feeling disconnected from their organizations purpose and unclear on how to meet expectations since the coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work.
Content: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. AP Illustration  Annie Ng NEW YORK AP  When Nikelle Inman started a new job coaching first-generation college students, she looked forward to meeting with them one-on-one to talk about how to surmount obstacles and find resources to succeed. Instead, she and her fellow success coaches at a community college in North Carolina spent a year mired in paperwork, tasked with reviewing applications from aspiring undergraduates. They never did get to meet with students. Admissions work kind of took over what we were supposed to do, Inman, 34, said. I felt disengaged with the position, more so because I just didnt feel valued. Its disorienting when a job turns out to be completely different than advertised or morphs into something we didnt expect. But more U.S. workers have reported feeling disconnected from their organizations purpose and unclear on how to meet expectations since the coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work, according to a new Gallup analysis. Just under half of U.S. employees who participated in a Gallup survey in November strongly agreed that they know what is expected of them at work, which is one of the factors the polling firm uses to measure employee engagement. In January 2020, the figure stood at 56. The new survey showed that new employees, younger employees, people in white-collar industries like technology, insurance and finance, and those in hybrid work arrangements were especially likely to report that expectations for their roles werent clear. This article is part of APs Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. The findings make intuitive sense. Managers and employees have bushwhacked their way through disruptive changes since COVID-19 first upended public life five years ago. In late 2024, about one-quarter of employees with the ability to work remotely were doing so exclusively, up from around 1 in 10 in 2019, Gallup found. Another 55 were working in the office some days and remotely the rest, according to the 2024 data, up from about one-third in 2019. More recently, layoffs at tech companies and in the government and other sectors have left organizations with fewer people to handle the load, and expectations arent always adjusted to the new realities. With all the rounds of layoffs, peoples scope and responsibilities are shifting constantly, said Jeremy Guttenplan, an executive leadership trainer and coach based in New York. You think about the ones left behind and the work is just getting piled on them. Here are some strategies for eliminating confusion when the scope and responsibilities of a job are ambiguous. Spell out or make sure you understand what a new role or project entails  along with any relevant deadlines or performance markers  from the beginning so everyone agrees on whats realistic and wanted. Writing it down in a shared document can help prevent future misunderstandings. When a successful real estate developer asked Amber Krasinski to film and produce 85 TikTok videos in three hours, she thought hard about whether she really wanted to take him on as a client. The job might be good exposure for her communications agency, IvyHill Stategies, but Krasinski knew it would be impossible to complete in so little time. She turned it down. Krasinski regularly gives her client progress updates and tries to make a practice of asking clarifying questions before taking on new projects. Any time I have a conversation with a prospective client, I have that in the back of my mind, Krasinski said. Avoiding that people-pleasing side that says, You can figure it out, you can do it. You dont want to let anybody down, but you also need to set yourself up for success. No one wants to spend all day in meetings. But more frequent check-ins with a manager or supervisor may help staff members who are unsure if they are prioritizing their time appropriately or dont know what they are supposed to be doing. Organizations can explore different ways of building connection between employees and providing more opportunities for feedback, which can result in better understanding of workplace expectations. Brian Smith, founder and managing partner of IA Business Advisors, said his company hosts gratitude sessions for 30 minutes each week. The first 20 minutes are led by a coach who advises attendees on issues such as how to effectively manage time or deal with challenging customers. Highlighting specific problems and strategies can help workers understand whats expected of them. At the end of the session, participants have an opportunity to share what theyre grateful for. Workers dont have to wait for a supervisor to seek feedback or clarify expectations. You can suggest a quick check-in at any point, if youre unsure how to prioritize long-term goals or short-term deadlines, Managing upwards is going to make your life easier, said Dale Whelehan, founder of 4 Day World, a think tank that explores new models of work. Dont assume that management has all the answers. Theyre probably just as lost. However, in hierarchical organizations where questioning management may be viewed negatively, its important to be delicate, he said. To initiate a feedback discussion, you can ask to meet with a manager about a current project. Whelehan outlined how to approach the conversation if the meeting gets scheduled. Start by sharing what you understand your assignment to be. Then request the managers confirmation or clarification by saying something such as, I just want to make sure that theres alignment here, he advised. Ask about anything else you need to clarify and close out the conversation by saying, From what I understand from this conversation, my role is this. ... Have I understood that correctly? Follow up with an email restating what you agreed to, Whelehan said. With workplaces experiencing so many changes, employees can find themselves jumping from one assignment to the other, distracted by new responsibilities picked up after colleagues were laid off, or adjusting to spending more time physically in the office. If it all feels too chaotic, take a moment to pause. Revisit your priorities. And then work on the most important task. If something doesnt feel right, dont just accept it, Inman said. Whatever that avenue is, if its staying and trying to make it better or leaving, just dont give up on what you know is right. ____ Have you overcome an obstacle or made a profound change in your work?

Dr. Will Farmer looked down from a viewing point, admiring the speed and agility of the 1,000-pound animals. The whole world will have the chance to see horses in action here Saturday, when the Kentucky Derby shines a global spotlight on equine athleticism.

Kentucky Derby entrant Citizen Bull works out at Churchill Downs Monday, April 28, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. AP PhotoCharlie Riedel It goes back to the roots They are an animal of prey, said Farmer, a veterinarian and equine medical director at Churchill Downs Inc. Thats how they got away from being eaten. APs Lisa Dwyer reports on what makes horse races such as the Kentucky Derby such a success. Horses honed skills such as running, jumping and pulling as humans bred and trained them for various purposes over millennia. And the 151st Derby  horse racings most-watched event  will draw attention not only to the animals skills, but also to concerns about their treatment and health. Advocates have long raised concerns about deaths and injuries  calls that were amplified two years ago, when 12 horses died at Churchill Downs. Theres no doubt that war, agriculture and societies have been transformed by the human-horse relationship. Horses allowed us to circumvent our own biological limitations as a species, said Timothy Winegard, a historian at Colorado Mesa University and author of a recent book, The Horse. We combined our brains with the horses size, strength, stamina and speed to form the most unstoppable animal coalition. A race horse works out at Churchill Downs Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. AP PhotoCharlie Riedel A horses heart and lungs are the source of its extraordinary power. The heart averages 10 to 12 pounds 4.5-5.4 kg, or about 1 of the animals body weight, compared with half a percent for the typical human heart. Secretariat, the storied horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973, was found after his death to have a heart weighing more than 20 pounds 9.1 kg. Horse hearts are built for exertion. The average horse can go from a resting heart rate of about 34 beats per minute to 220 or 240 while racing  faster than a human heart during maximum exertion. One thing thats really unique about horses is that they have an incredible capacity to move blood around their bodies -- their heart rate can go really high and still be safe, said University of Connecticut researcher Sarah Reed, editor in chief of the journal Animal Frontiers. They also have a lung capacity of 60 liters  10 times that of humans. That massive lung field allows for oxygen to transfer from the air into their blood, which is vitally important for sustaining aerobic energy, Farmer said. Recent research in the journal Science found that a genetic mutation enables horses to avoid negative side effects of super high energy production. Horses are great athletes because they can deliver a lot of oxygen to their muscles  way more than an elite human can and by elite human, I mean Olympic athlete, said Gianni Castiglione, the studys co-author. They have a bigger tank of gas and they have a more efficient engine  and this mutation is contributing to both of those things. A race horse works out at Churchill Downs Tuesday, April 29, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. AP PhotoCharlie Riedel Other aspects of a horses biology enhance its abilities. Horses store extra red blood cells in their spleens. These cells are released to carry even more oxygen around the body during intense exertion. Adrenaline when exercising causes the spleen to release extra red blood cells into circulation, veterinarian Hilary Clayton said. What horses are doing is essentially blood doping themselves. Meanwhile, horses brains allow them to process sensory information and react quickly. Thats despite having frontal lobes, parts of the brain used for thought and planning that are proportionally smaller than those in humans. Brainwise, theyre designed with a real desire to play and run independent of any fear, said Dr. Scott Bailey, a veterinarian at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, a thoroughbred breeding farm where Secretariat is buried. Horses are also able to focus intently, which is really important for an athlete. Bone structure and musculature also help. The ligaments and tendons in their hind legs act like springs, Farmer said, helping propel them forward. Like other large prey animals, he added, they have long, thin legs that are meant to run. The adaptations that make horses faster also predispose them to injury, Reed said. Their skinny legs absorb the impact of each stride, she said, and over time the repetitive stress of racing and training can lead to deformation of tendons and ligaments. In 2023, deaths occurred not only at Churchill Downs, but other major racing venues, affecting public perceptions of the sport and sparking changes. Reviews found no single cause for the deaths. But for 2024, Churchill Downs upgraded equipment used on its dirt surface and added an equine safety and integrity veterinarian. In its annual report, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority noted the steps being taken to reduce injuries and fatalities  expanded veterinary protocols, pre-race inspections and uniform medication oversight. And, it said, the rate of deaths at authority-accredited tracks dropped in 2024, by 27. Kentucky Derby entrant Journalism gets a bath after a workout at Churchill Downs Tuesday, April 29, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. AP PhotoCharlie Riedel Experts say a healthy, safe environment brings out the best in a horse  but they still dont know what makes certain horses standouts at the race track. Thats the million-dollar question, Bailey said. Every thoroughbred owner is trying to match the genetics of the parents in order to make the horse with the greatest chance of winning. Breeding is only part of the equation, experts said nurture, training and the horse-rider relationship also factor in. Each time a horse emerges seemingly out of nowhere to win the Kentucky Derby, Farmer is reminded of this. You dont have to be this star-studded bred horse that cost a million dollars at sale to come and win and be a great runner, he said, raising his voice slightly above the din of galloping hooves. There are a lot of great horses. ___ Larson reported from Washington, D.C.

Wellness practitioners and mental health clinicians say anxiety and depression among those they serve in migrant communities have spread and intensified this year. Already, migrants often arrive with severe trauma from violence they fled in their home countries as well as attacks along cartel-controlled routes to and through the U.S. border. Women in particular often suffer sexual violence on the journey. For many, the fear that they or someone in their families might be deported is revictimizing. That makes it imperative that safe places exist where they can focus on wellness, said Noeline Maldonado, executive director of The Healing Center, which helps domestic and sexual violence victims in Brooklyn, New York. Sessions that promote grounding and mindfulness are necessary to cope with the stress of both immediate crises as well as long-term unpredictability as immigration policies shift. Uncertainty is the biggest thing, said Cheryl Aguilar, director of Hope Center for Wellness in the Washington, D.C., area, which has partnered with churches to provide mental health programs. Being in community and cultivating hope is crucial because many people are responding to fear with rising anxiety, traumatic symptoms and isolation, all of which can have lasting consequences, Aguilar added. Its nonstop work, nonstop fear, said Sarah Howell, a clinical social worker in Houston with more than a decade of experience in migration-related trauma. Every issue seems bigger. Howell said many of her clients in Texas are realizing they cant live in a state of constant alarm, and the respite that wellness programs can bring becomes essential. People feel hopeless, but they have to keep fighting, said Guadalupe Gonzalez, one of the bilingual Reiki practitioners whose organization, Odigo Wellness, partnered with St. Pauls in Minneapolis to offer the sessions. She said she had some doubts about offering these healing practices inside a church  a large space with light flooding in and people moving through. But the sanctuary has a very nice, very positive energy, Gonzalez said. As practitioners we feel a lot of emotions. Several congregants who attended last Sundays two-hour wellness session said they felt both the energy and the connection between these healing practices and faith. Martha Dominguez came bouncing down the altar steps after an acupuncture session. Grinning, she said she had never imagined a church would offer these kinds of benefits. Yes, it helps so much, said the Mexican immigrant. It takes the stress away from you. Limber Saliero, a roofer from Ecuador who has been worshipping at St. Pauls for more than a year, said he had never heard of acupuncture but decided to try it. I felt like an energy that was flowing into me, he said. Vanessa Arcos tried acupuncture with her sister and her father, while her mother got a Reiki treatment. The family started attending the church the week they arrived in Minnesota from their home state of Guerrero, Mexico, almost a decade ago. Lying in the lounge chair next to a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Arcos said she overcame her fear of needles and found the treatment relaxing for both muscles and mind. It felt very peaceful, very safe, Arcos said. Its important to do little things for yourself. ___ This story has been updated to correct Lizete Vegas job title to family engagement coordinator instead of its Latino outreach coordinator.

"Title: In the rapidly shifting world of work, many employees are unclear whats expected of them
Description: More workers have reported feeling disconnected from their organizations purpose and unclear on how to meet expectations since the coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work.
Content: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. AP Illustration  Annie Ng NEW YORK AP  When Nikelle Inman started a new job coaching first-generation college students, she looked forward to meeting with them one-on-one to talk about how to surmount obstacles and find resources to succeed. Instead, she and her fellow success coaches at a community college in North Carolina spent a year mired in paperwork, tasked with reviewing applications from aspiring undergraduates. They never did get to meet with students. Admissions work kind of took over what we were supposed to do, Inman, 34, said. I felt disengaged with the position, more so because I just didnt feel valued. Its disorienting when a job turns out to be completely different than advertised or morphs into something we didnt expect. But more U.S. workers have reported feeling disconnected from their organizations purpose and unclear on how to meet expectations since the coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work, according to a new Gallup analysis. Just under half of U.S. employees who participated in a Gallup survey in November strongly agreed that they know what is expected of them at work, which is one of the factors the polling firm uses to measure employee engagement. In January 2020, the figure stood at 56. The new survey showed that new employees, younger employees, people in white-collar industries like technology, insurance and finance, and those in hybrid work arrangements were especially likely to report that expectations for their roles werent clear. This article is part of APs Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. The findings make intuitive sense. Managers and employees have bushwhacked their way through disruptive changes since COVID-19 first upended public life five years ago. In late 2024, about one-quarter of employees with the ability to work remotely were doing so exclusively, up from around 1 in 10 in 2019, Gallup found. Another 55 were working in the office some days and remotely the rest, according to the 2024 data, up from about one-third in 2019. More recently, layoffs at tech companies and in the government and other sectors have left organizations with fewer people to handle the load, and expectations arent always adjusted to the new realities. With all the rounds of layoffs, peoples scope and responsibilities are shifting constantly, said Jeremy Guttenplan, an executive leadership trainer and coach based in New York. You think about the ones left behind and the work is just getting piled on them. Here are some strategies for eliminating confusion when the scope and responsibilities of a job are ambiguous. Spell out or make sure you understand what a new role or project entails  along with any relevant deadlines or performance markers  from the beginning so everyone agrees on whats realistic and wanted. Writing it down in a shared document can help prevent future misunderstandings. When a successful real estate developer asked Amber Krasinski to film and produce 85 TikTok videos in three hours, she thought hard about whether she really wanted to take him on as a client. The job might be good exposure for her communications agency, IvyHill Stategies, but Krasinski knew it would be impossible to complete in so little time. She turned it down. Krasinski regularly gives her client progress updates and tries to make a practice of asking clarifying questions before taking on new projects. Any time I have a conversation with a prospective client, I have that in the back of my mind, Krasinski said. Avoiding that people-pleasing side that says, You can figure it out, you can do it. You dont want to let anybody down, but you also need to set yourself up for success. No one wants to spend all day in meetings. But more frequent check-ins with a manager or supervisor may help staff members who are unsure if they are prioritizing their time appropriately or dont know what they are supposed to be doing. Organizations can explore different ways of building connection between employees and providing more opportunities for feedback, which can result in better understanding of workplace expectations. Brian Smith, founder and managing partner of IA Business Advisors, said his company hosts gratitude sessions for 30 minutes each week. The first 20 minutes are led by a coach who advises attendees on issues such as how to effectively manage time or deal with challenging customers. Highlighting specific problems and strategies can help workers understand whats expected of them. At the end of the session, participants have an opportunity to share what theyre grateful for. Workers dont have to wait for a supervisor to seek feedback or clarify expectations. You can suggest a quick check-in at any point, if youre unsure how to prioritize long-term goals or short-term deadlines, Managing upwards is going to make your life easier, said Dale Whelehan, founder of 4 Day World, a think tank that explores new models of work. Dont assume that management has all the answers. Theyre probably just as lost. However, in hierarchical organizations where questioning management may be viewed negatively, its important to be delicate, he said. To initiate a feedback discussion, you can ask to meet with a manager about a current project. Whelehan outlined how to approach the conversation if the meeting gets scheduled. Start by sharing what you understand your assignment to be. Then request the managers confirmation or clarification by saying something such as, I just want to make sure that theres alignment here, he advised. Ask about anything else you need to clarify and close out the conversation by saying, From what I understand from this conversation, my role is this. ... Have I understood that correctly? Follow up with an email restating what you agreed to, Whelehan said. With workplaces experiencing so many changes, employees can find themselves jumping from one assignment to the other, distracted by new responsibilities picked up after colleagues were laid off, or adjusting to spending more time physically in the office. If it all feels too chaotic, take a moment to pause. Revisit your priorities. And then work on the most important task. If something doesnt feel right, dont just accept it, Inman said. Whatever that avenue is, if its staying and trying to make it better or leaving, just dont give up on what you know is right. ____ Have you overcome an obstacle or made a profound change in your work?

"Title: OpenAI picks labor icon Dolores Huerta and other philanthropy advisers as it moves toward for-profit
Description: OpenAI has named labor leader Dolores Huerta and three others to a temporary advisory board that will help guide the artificial intelligence companys philanthropy as it attempts to shift itself into a for-profit business.

Honoree Dolores Huerta attends The Albies hosted by the Clooney Foundation for Justice at the New York Public Library on Thursday, Sept. 26, 2024, in New York. Photo by Evan AgostiniInvisionAP, file OpenAI has named labor leader Dolores Huerta and three others to a temporary advisory board that will help guide the artificial intelligence companys philanthropy as it attempts to shift itself into a for-profit business. Huerta, who turned 95 last week, formed the first farmworkers union with Cesar Chavez in the early 1960s and will now voice her ideas on the direction of philanthropic initiatives that OpenAI says will consider both the promise and risks of AI. The group will have just 90 days to make their suggestions. She recognizes the significance of AI in todays world and anybody whos been paying attention for the last 50 years knows she will be a force in this conversation, said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAIs new nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. Huertas advice wont be binding but the presence of a social activist icon could be influential as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attempts a costly restructuring of the San Francisco companys corporate governance, which requires the approval of Californias attorney general and others. Another coalition of labor leaders and nonprofits recently petitioned state Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, to investigate OpenAI, halt the proposed conversion and protect billions of dollars that are under threat as profit-driven hunger for power yields conflicts of interest. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started out in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory dedicated to safely building better-than-human AI that benefits humanity. It later formed a for-profit arm and shifted most of its staff there, but is still controlled by a nonprofit board of directors. It is now trying to convert itself more fully into a for-profit corporation but faces a number of hurdles, including getting the approval of California and Delaware attorneys general, potentially buying out the nonprofits pricy assets and fighting a lawsuit from co-founder and early investor Elon Musk. Backed by Japanese tech giant SoftBank, OpenAI last month said its working to raise 40 billion in funding, putting its value at 300 billion. Huerta will be joined on the new advisory commission by former Spanish-language media executive Monica Lozano Robert Ross, the recently retired president of The California Endowment and Jack Oliver, an attorney and longtime Republican campaign fundraiser. Zingale, the groups convener, is a former aide to California governors including Democrat Gavin Newsom and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. Were interested in how you put the power of AI in the hands of everyday people and the community organizations that serve them, Zingale said in an interview Wednesday. Because, if AI is going to bring a renaissance, or a dark age, these are the people you want to tip the scale in favor of humanity. The group is now tasked with gathering community feedback for the problems OpenAIs philanthropy could work to address. But for California nonprofit leaders pushing for legal action from the state attorney general, it doesnt alter what they view as the states duty to pause the restructuring, assess the value of OpenAIs charitable assets and make sure they are used in the publics interest. As impressive as the individual members of OpenAIs advisory commission are, the commission itself appears to be a calculated distraction from the core problem OpenAI misappropriating its nonprofit assets for private gain, said Orson Aguilar, the CEO and founding president of LatinoProsperity, in a written statement. - The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of APs text archives.

Stefan RousseauPool Foto vía AP KIEV, Ucrania AP  En una muestra de unidad en Kiev el sábado, los dirigentes de cuatro importantes países europeos amenazaron con aumentar la presión si el presidente ruso Vladímir Putin no acepta un cese del fuego incondicional de 30 días. Los mandatarios de Francia, el Reino Unido, Alemania y Polonia dijeron que la propuesta de iniciar el cese del fuego el lunes cuenta con el apoyo del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, a quien habían informado por teléfono más temprano ese día. Su declaración se produjo en medio de crecientes esfuerzos para persuadir a Moscú de aceptar una tregua que permitiría conversaciones de paz para poner fin a más de tres años de guerra a gran escala. La exigencia fue anunciada en una conferencia de prensa conjunta con el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyy y los países que lideran la llamada coalición de los dispuestos un grupo de más de 30 países que se han comprometido a fortalecer a Ucrania para disuadir la agresión rusa. Entre ellos se encontraban el presidente francés Emmanuel Macron, el primer ministro británico Keir Starmer, el canciller alemán Friedrich Merz y el primer ministro polaco Donald Tusk, quienes viajaron el sábado juntos a Ucrania por primera vez. El cese del fuego incluiría un alto a los combates en tierra, mar y aire. Los líderes amenazaron con aumentar las sanciones, incluidas las del sector energético y bancario de Rusia, si Putin no cumple. Horas antes, el ministro de Asuntos Exteriores de Ucrania, Andrii Sybiha, dijo que Kiev y sus aliados están listos para un cese del fuego completo e incondicional con Rusia durante al menos 30 días a partir del lunes. Agregó que los cuatro líderes visitantes y Zelenskyy habían tenido una llamada telefónica constructiva con Trump. El sábado fue el último día del cese del fuego unilateral de tres días declarado por Rusia, que, según Ucrania, las fuerzas del Kremlin han violado repetidamente. En marzo, Estados Unidos propuso una tregua inmediata y limitada de 30 días, que Ucrania aceptó, pero el Kremlin ha insistido en términos que le sean más favorables. Fortalecer las capacidades militares de Ucrania será un elemento clave para disuadir a Rusia , dijeron el sábado los líderes europeos. Esto requerirá suministrar a Ucrania cantidades robustas de armas para disuadir futuros ataques e invertir en su sector de defensa. Una fuerza compuesta por tropas extranjeras también podría desplegarse como una medida adicional de tranquilidad, dijo Macron. El presidente francés agregó que Estados Unidos tomará la delantera en la supervisión de un cese del fuego propuesto, con el apoyo de países europeos, y amenazó con sanciones masivas... preparadas y coordinadas entre europeos y estadounidenses, si Rusia viola la tregua. Pero dijo que los detalles sobre posibles despliegues europeos en Ucrania aún se están afinando. No se mencionó la membresía en la OTAN, que sigue siendo la principal opción de Kiev para una garantía de seguridad. La prioridad es hacer que la guerra sea demasiado costosa para que Rusia continúe luchando, dijo Sybiha a los reporteros al margen del evento. El teniente general retirado Keith Kellogg, enviado especial de Trump para Ucrania y Rusia, dijo el sábado que un cese del fuego integral de 30 días, que cubra ataques desde el aire, tierra, mar y sobre infraestructura, iniciará el proceso para poner fin a la guerra más grande y larga en Europa desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Más temprano el sábado, los líderes europeos se unieron a una ceremonia en la Plaza de la Independencia de Kiev para conmemorar el 80mo aniversario del final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Encendieron velas junto a Zelenskyy en un memorial improvisado con banderas en honor a los soldados ucranianos caídos y a los civiles asesinados desde la invasión rusa. Trump ha presionado a ambas partes para llegar rápidamente a un acuerdo para poner fin a la guerra, pero mientras Zelenskyy aceptó el plan estadounidense para una pausa inicial de 30 días en las hostilidades, Rusia no ha firmado. En cambio, ha seguido lanzando ataques a lo largo de los aproximadamente 1.600 kilómetros 1.000 millas del frente, incluyendo operaciones letales en zonas residenciales sin objetivos militares evidentes. El sábado por la mañana, funcionarios de la región de Sumy, en el norte de Ucrania, reportaron que los bombardeos rusos de la víspera mataron a tres residentes e hirieron a otros cuatro. Otro civil murió en el acto el sábado cuando un dron ruso alcanzó la ciudad sureña de Jersón, según el gobernador regional, Oleksandr Prokudin. Hablando con reporteros en Kiev, el presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron, dijo Lo que está sucediendo con Polonia, Alemania y el Reino Unido es un momento histórico para la defensa europea y hacia una mayor independencia para nuestra seguridad. Obviamente para Ucrania, pero también para todos nosotros. Es una nueva era. Es una Europa que se ve a sí misma como una potencia. La semana pasada, Trump señaló que duda que el presidente de Rusia, Vladímir Putin, quiera poner fin a su guerra en Ucrania, expresando un nuevo escepticismo de que se pueda alcanzar un acuerdo de paz pronto, y sugirió más sanciones contra Rusia. El progreso para poner fin a la guerra ha parecido esquivo en los meses desde que Trump regresó a la Casa Blanca, y sus afirmaciones anteriores de avances inminentes no se han materializado. Trump ha presionado en el pasado a Ucrania para ceder territorio a Rusia y poner fin a la guerra, y amenazó con retirarse si el acuerdo se complica, lo que ha hecho sonar las alarmas en Europa acerca de cómo llenar ese vacío. Los aliados europeos de Ucrania ven la guerra como fundamental para la seguridad del continente, por lo que se ha incrementado la presión para encontrar formas de respaldar militarmente a Kiev, con independencia de que la Casa Blanca se retire. ___ El periodista de The Associated Press Thomas Adamson en París contribuyó a este despacho. ___ Esta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.

"Title: Cyprus and Israel seek to quickly establish an electricity linkup via an undersea cable
Description: Cyprus energy minister says the east Mediterranean island nation and neighbor Israel are seeking to swiftly establish an electricity linkup via an undersea cable.
Content: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. NICOSIA, Cyprus AP  Cyprus and neighboring Israel are seeking to swiftly establish an electricity linkup via an undersea cable that would eliminate their respective energy isolation, an official said Monday. Energy Minister George Papanastasiou said that Israel is particularly keen to ensure that it can rely on Cypriot energy reserves from both conventional and renewable sources to power the country if the need ever arises. Pananastasiou told The Associated Press that Cyprus would soon have the capacity to generate around four gigawatts of electricity from fossil fuels as well as solar and wind sources, while consuming only 0.5 GW. Wind turbines and photovoltaics generate 1 GW of electricity, but licenses have been issued for construction of new wind and solar energy parks with a capacity of 2.8 GW. Conventional fuels generate 1.4 GW. The shared commitment for an electricity cable link was affirmed Sunday when Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a daylong visit to Israel and Ramallah, West Bank. Both leaders said that the electricity link would showcase the two countries geographical location as the natural gateways between Europe and the Middle East. Papanastasiou said given this geographical advantage, the two leaders agreed to pursue the potential benefits from the establishment of a trade, energy and digital connectivity corridor between India, the Middle East and Europe. The corridor, known as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, or IMEC, was unveiled at the India-hosted Group of 20 summit of the worlds leading rich and developing nations in 2023. Netanyahu said Sunday that he had recently spoken with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi about IMEC, which he said was a very revolutionary and transformative development that we want to bring into place. Separately, an electricity cable project to link Greece with Cyprus is already underway. The 1.94 billion-euro 2.19 billion Great Seas Interconnector, or GSI, is partly funded by the European Union to the tune of 800 million euros 903 million. Progress has been slowed because of Turkish objections over the cables course. Turkey says the project cant proceed without its consent because the cable would pass through waters it claims are under its jurisdiction. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

"Title: How US-China tariffs reached sky-high levels in 3 months
Description: Talks planned this weekend between U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland are a culmination of more than three months of dizzying rounds of retaliatory tariffs between the two countries that have crippled each others exporters and dragged on their economies.
Content: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. TAIPEI, Taiwan AP  Talks planned this weekend between U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland are a culmination of more than three months of dizzying rounds of retaliatory tariffs between the two countries that have crippled each others exporters and dragged on their economies. Washington and Beijing are entering talks with tariffs on each others goods at an all-time high. U.S. duties on Chinese imports stand at 145, while Chinas retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods have reached 125. U.S. President Donald Trump said he believed the talks could bring tangible progress, and that he was open to lowering the tariffs substantially if Beijing made concessions. China, however, has reiterated calls for Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of the talks. Here is a play-by-play of how U.S. and Chinese tariffs have reached such sky-high levels since the beginning of Trumps second term in office Trump signs an executive order imposing 10 tariffs on China, as well as 25 duties on Mexico and Canada. He later announces a 30-day reprieve on the Mexican and Canadian tariffs. The 10 tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S. come into effect. China retaliates the same day by announcing a flurry of countermeasures, including duties on American coal, liquefied natural gas and agricultural machinery. Trump imposes additional 10 tariffs on all Chinese goods, bringing the total level of duties to 20. China responds with tariffs of up to 15 on imports of key U.S. farm products including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies. Chinese tariffs and measures announced on March 4 go into effect. On Trumps so-called tariff Liberation Day, he announces additional 34 duties on all Chinese imports, alongside tariffs on goods from countries around the world. The sweeping tariffs are to come into effect April 9. China fights back by imposing 34 tariffs on all U.S. goods, effective April 10, as well as other retaliatory measures including more export controls on rare earth minerals. China also suspends imports of sorghum, poultry and bonemeal from several U.S. companies, adds 27 firms to lists of companies facing trade restrictions, and starts an anti-monopoly probe into DuPont China Group, a subsidiary of the U.S. company DuPont. Trump threatens China with additional 50 tariffs if it doesnt roll back its 34 reciprocal tariffs. Trumps Liberation Day tariffs come into effect. The U.S. raises tariffs on China even higher than previously announced, to 104. Beijing retaliates with duties of 84 on U.S. goods, effective April 10. Trump further raises tariffs on all Chinese goods to 145, effective immediately. China raises its tariffs on all U.S. goods to 125, effective April 12. Beijing says it would not raise the duties any further. The Trump administration announces that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva. China will be represented at the talks by Vice Premier He Lifeng. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",1

AP PhotoGiovanna DellOrto MINNEAPOLIS AP  Right after Sunday worship at St. Pauls-San Pablo Lutheran Church, Juan Carlos Toapanta lay in a lounge chair set up by the altar, needles sticking out of his forehead, wrist and foot for an hourlong acupuncture session. Just like the Lords light helps emotionally, the bodys pain is treated as well, said the Ecuadorian construction worker, who suffers from sciatica and has worshipped at the Minneapolis church for about five months. Everything feels freed, emotionally. Founded by Swedish immigrants in the late 19th century, the church is now a predominantly Latino congregation. Like most other churches in the U.S. that serve migrants, it has expanded its humanitarian, financial, legal and pastoral ministries during the Trump administrations immigration crackdown. It has also added monthly well-being sessions  at no charge  with acupuncture, Reiki and cupping therapy to ease the stress that uncertainty and fear have sown among the migrant community  including people in the U.S. illegally and U.S.-born citizens in mixed-status families. We have to feel well to respond well, not with panic and fear, which leads to nothing good, said Lizete Vega, the churchs family engagement coordinator. People here feel that theyre protected and can be cared for spiritually, emotionally and physically. Faith leaders have increasingly found themselves called to help their congregations with mental health concerns, from chaplains in the U.S. Navy to pastors in the rural heartland. Some see the need to provide reassurance and well-being as a growing part of their ministry to migrants, even as revised federal immigration guidelines now provide more leeway for enforcement in or near houses of worship. It was as if they were able to exhale a big breath, the Rev. Hierald Osorto said of the 30 congregants who signed up for the first well-being session in March at St. Pauls, where an outdoor mural features two traditional Swedish Dala horses between the Spanish words sanación healing and resiliencia resilience. After last Sundays worship, the altar table and Easter lilies were moved to make room for seven acupuncture chairs, arranged in a circle facing the central cross. Three massage tables were set up in front of the pews for the Reiki treatment, where practitioners hold their hands on or near the bodys energy centers. To see this space be quite literally a place of healing, in the place where we talk about it right at the altar, it moved me to tears, Osorto said. Wellness practitioners and mental health clinicians say anxiety and depression among those they serve in migrant communities have spread and intensified this year. Already, migrants often arrive with severe trauma from violence they fled in their home countries as well as attacks along cartel-controlled routes to and through the U.S. border. Women in particular often suffer sexual violence on the journey. For many, the fear that they or someone in their families might be deported is revictimizing. That makes it imperative that safe places exist where they can focus on wellness, said Noeline Maldonado, executive director of The Healing Center, which helps domestic and sexual violence victims in Brooklyn, New York. Sessions that promote grounding and mindfulness are necessary to cope with the stress of both immediate crises as well as long-term unpredictability as immigration policies shift. Uncertainty is the biggest thing, said Cheryl Aguilar, director of Hope Center for Wellness in the Washington, D.C., area, which has partnered with churches to provide mental health programs. Being in community and cultivating hope is crucial because many people are responding to fear with rising anxiety, traumatic symptoms and isolation, all of which can have lasting consequences, Aguilar added. Its nonstop work, nonstop fear, said Sarah Howell, a clinical social worker in Houston with more than a decade of experience in migration-related trauma. Every issue seems bigger. Howell said many of her clients in Texas are realizing they cant live in a state of constant alarm, and the respite that wellness programs can bring becomes essential. People feel hopeless, but they have to keep fighting, said Guadalupe Gonzalez, one of the bilingual Reiki practitioners whose organization, Odigo Wellness, partnered with St. Pauls in Minneapolis to offer the sessions. She said she had some doubts about offering these healing practices inside a church  a large space with light flooding in and people moving through. But the sanctuary has a very nice, very positive energy, Gonzalez said. As practitioners we feel a lot of emotions. Several congregants who attended last Sundays two-hour wellness session said they felt both the energy and the connection between these healing practices and faith. Martha Dominguez came bouncing down the altar steps after an acupuncture session. Grinning, she said she had never imagined a church would offer these kinds of benefits. Yes, it helps so much, said the Mexican immigrant. It takes the stress away from you. Limber Saliero, a roofer from Ecuador who has been worshipping at St. Pauls for more than a year, said he had never heard of acupuncture but decided to try it. I felt like an energy that was flowing into me, he said. Vanessa Arcos tried acupuncture with her sister and her father, while her mother got a Reiki treatment. The family started attending the church the week they arrived in Minnesota from their home state of Guerrero, Mexico, almost a decade ago. Lying in the lounge chair next to a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Arcos said she overcame her fear of needles and found the treatment relaxing for both muscles and mind. It felt very peaceful, very safe, Arcos said. Its important to do little things for yourself. ___ This story has been updated to correct Lizete Vegas job title to family engagement coordinator instead of its Latino outreach coordinator.

AP PhotoRichard Drew NEW YORK AP  U.S. stocks rose Thursday after the United States and United Kingdom announced a deal on trade that would lower some tariffs between the two countries, the first of what Wall Street hopes will be enough agreements to keep a recession from hitting the economy. The SP 500 climbed 0.6 for its 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 254 points, or 0.6, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1. It wasnt just stocks. Bitcoin jumped back above 101,000, and crude oil prices climbed, while the price of gold eased back as investors felt less need for safety. Treasury yields rose on bets that more trade deals with other countries may mean the Federal Reserve wont need to cut interest rates as sharply as feared in order to prop up the economy. Stocks and other financial markets have been swinging for weeks with hopes that President Donald Trump could reach such deals that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked. Trump on Thursday lauded what he called a maxed-out trade deal with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10 tariffs on U.K. products but would lower taxes on U.K. automobiles in exchange for greater access in the U.K. market for U.S. beef, ethanol and other products. Trump said it may take weeks to finalize all the details in the U.K. deal, but he also gave potentially encouraging updates on talks pending with an even bigger trading partner, China. The worlds second-largest economy is set to meet with high-level U.S. officials in Switzerland this weekend. China has been calling for the United States to cancel its tariffs, while Trump has said that he wouldnt reduce his 145 tariffs on Chinese goods as a condition for negotiations. Asked on Thursday whether he would consider lowering tariffs on Chinese imports if this weekends talks go well, Trump said, It could be. Were going to see. Right now, you cant get any higher. Its at 145. So we know its coming down. He also said he expects the talks in Switzerland to be substantive. Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from U.S. companies have also helped to drive the SP 500 closer to its all-time high set in February. Its back within 7.8 after dropping nearly 20 below the mark a month ago. Axon Enterprise, the company that sells Tasers, body cameras and other public safety equipment, jumped 14.1 after joining the list. It benefited from strong growth for its software and services, and it raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Tapestry rose 3.7 after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands also reported better profit and revenue than expected. It credited new, younger customers in North America, among other things. Molson Coors, though, described a different landscape when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts expectations. Its stock fell 4.5. The global macroeconomic environment is volatile, CEO Gavin Hattersley said. Uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade policy, including the impacts on economic growth, consumer confidence and expectations around inflation, and currencies has pressured the beer industry and consumption trends. It became the latest company to either lower or pull its financial forecasts for 2025 given the uncertainty. Krispy Kreme tumbled 24.7 after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year. The doughnut seller said it made the move in part because of macroeconomic softness and because its pausing the rollout of sales of its doughnuts at more McDonalds restaurants. All told, the SP 500 rose 32.66 points to 5,663.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 254.48 to 41,368.45, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 189.98 to 17,928.14. The U.S. economy has remained OK so far, with the Federal Reserve saying Wednesday that it still looks to be running at a solid rate underneath the surface. But pessimism has soured sharply among U.S. households because of tariffs, and the fear is that all the uncertainty created by them could be enough to force the economy into a recession. A couple reports on the economy Thursday came in mixed. One said slightly fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. But another said productivity for U.S. workers slowed by more than economists expected at the start of the year. That could keep upward pressure on inflation, when tariffs could be set to raise prices for all kinds of imported products. Treasury yields rose following the reports, and the 10-year yield climbed to 4.38 from 4.26 late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for action by the Fed, leaped to 3.89 from 3.78. Traders pared back expectations for how many times the Fed may cut interest rates later this year. In stock markets abroad, the FTSE 100 slipped 0.3 in London after the Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Indexes rose across much of the rest of Europe and Asia. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",1
"Title: In the rapidly shifting world of work, many employees are unclear whats expected of them
Description: More workers have reported feeling disconnected from their organizations purpose and unclear on how to meet expectations since the coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work.
Content: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. AP Illustration  Annie Ng NEW YORK AP  When Nikelle Inman started a new job coaching first-generation college students, she looked forward to meeting with them one-on-one to talk about how to surmount obstacles and find resources to succeed. Instead, she and her fellow success coaches at a community college in North Carolina spent a year mired in paperwork, tasked with reviewing applications from aspiring undergraduates. They never did get to meet with students. Admissions work kind of took over what we were supposed to do, Inman, 34, said. I felt disengaged with the position, more so because I just didnt feel valued. Its disorienting when a job turns out to be completely different than advertised or morphs into something we didnt expect. But more U.S. workers have reported feeling disconnected from their organizations purpose and unclear on how to meet expectations since the coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work, according to a new Gallup analysis. Just under half of U.S. employees who participated in a Gallup survey in November strongly agreed that they know what is expected of them at work, which is one of the factors the polling firm uses to measure employee engagement. In January 2020, the figure stood at 56. The new survey showed that new employees, younger employees, people in white-collar industries like technology, insurance and finance, and those in hybrid work arrangements were especially likely to report that expectations for their roles werent clear. This article is part of APs Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. The findings make intuitive sense. Managers and employees have bushwhacked their way through disruptive changes since COVID-19 first upended public life five years ago. In late 2024, about one-quarter of employees with the ability to work remotely were doing so exclusively, up from around 1 in 10 in 2019, Gallup found. Another 55 were working in the office some days and remotely the rest, according to the 2024 data, up from about one-third in 2019. More recently, layoffs at tech companies and in the government and other sectors have left organizations with fewer people to handle the load, and expectations arent always adjusted to the new realities. With all the rounds of layoffs, peoples scope and responsibilities are shifting constantly, said Jeremy Guttenplan, an executive leadership trainer and coach based in New York. You think about the ones left behind and the work is just getting piled on them. Here are some strategies for eliminating confusion when the scope and responsibilities of a job are ambiguous. Spell out or make sure you understand what a new role or project entails  along with any relevant deadlines or performance markers  from the beginning so everyone agrees on whats realistic and wanted. Writing it down in a shared document can help prevent future misunderstandings. When a successful real estate developer asked Amber Krasinski to film and produce 85 TikTok videos in three hours, she thought hard about whether she really wanted to take him on as a client. The job might be good exposure for her communications agency, IvyHill Stategies, but Krasinski knew it would be impossible to complete in so little time. She turned it down. Krasinski regularly gives her client progress updates and tries to make a practice of asking clarifying questions before taking on new projects. Any time I have a conversation with a prospective client, I have that in the back of my mind, Krasinski said. Avoiding that people-pleasing side that says, You can figure it out, you can do it. You dont want to let anybody down, but you also need to set yourself up for success. No one wants to spend all day in meetings. But more frequent check-ins with a manager or supervisor may help staff members who are unsure if they are prioritizing their time appropriately or dont know what they are supposed to be doing. Organizations can explore different ways of building connection between employees and providing more opportunities for feedback, which can result in better understanding of workplace expectations. Brian Smith, founder and managing partner of IA Business Advisors, said his company hosts gratitude sessions for 30 minutes each week. The first 20 minutes are led by a coach who advises attendees on issues such as how to effectively manage time or deal with challenging customers. Highlighting specific problems and strategies can help workers understand whats expected of them. At the end of the session, participants have an opportunity to share what theyre grateful for. Workers dont have to wait for a supervisor to seek feedback or clarify expectations. You can suggest a quick check-in at any point, if youre unsure how to prioritize long-term goals or short-term deadlines, Managing upwards is going to make your life easier, said Dale Whelehan, founder of 4 Day World, a think tank that explores new models of work. Dont assume that management has all the answers. Theyre probably just as lost. However, in hierarchical organizations where questioning management may be viewed negatively, its important to be delicate, he said. To initiate a feedback discussion, you can ask to meet with a manager about a current project. Whelehan outlined how to approach the conversation if the meeting gets scheduled. Start by sharing what you understand your assignment to be. Then request the managers confirmation or clarification by saying something such as, I just want to make sure that theres alignment here, he advised. Ask about anything else you need to clarify and close out the conversation by saying, From what I understand from this conversation, my role is this. ... Have I understood that correctly? Follow up with an email restating what you agreed to, Whelehan said. With workplaces experiencing so many changes, employees can find themselves jumping from one assignment to the other, distracted by new responsibilities picked up after colleagues were laid off, or adjusting to spending more time physically in the office. If it all feels too chaotic, take a moment to pause. Revisit your priorities. And then work on the most important task. If something doesnt feel right, dont just accept it, Inman said. Whatever that avenue is, if its staying and trying to make it better or leaving, just dont give up on what you know is right. ____ Have you overcome an obstacle or made a profound change in your work?

Stefan RousseauPool Foto vía AP KIEV, Ucrania AP  En una muestra de unidad en Kiev el sábado, los dirigentes de cuatro importantes países europeos amenazaron con aumentar la presión si el presidente ruso Vladímir Putin no acepta un cese del fuego incondicional de 30 días. Los mandatarios de Francia, el Reino Unido, Alemania y Polonia dijeron que la propuesta de iniciar el cese del fuego el lunes cuenta con el apoyo del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, a quien habían informado por teléfono más temprano ese día. Su declaración se produjo en medio de crecientes esfuerzos para persuadir a Moscú de aceptar una tregua que permitiría conversaciones de paz para poner fin a más de tres años de guerra a gran escala. La exigencia fue anunciada en una conferencia de prensa conjunta con el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyy y los países que lideran la llamada coalición de los dispuestos un grupo de más de 30 países que se han comprometido a fortalecer a Ucrania para disuadir la agresión rusa. Entre ellos se encontraban el presidente francés Emmanuel Macron, el primer ministro británico Keir Starmer, el canciller alemán Friedrich Merz y el primer ministro polaco Donald Tusk, quienes viajaron el sábado juntos a Ucrania por primera vez. El cese del fuego incluiría un alto a los combates en tierra, mar y aire. Los líderes amenazaron con aumentar las sanciones, incluidas las del sector energético y bancario de Rusia, si Putin no cumple. Horas antes, el ministro de Asuntos Exteriores de Ucrania, Andrii Sybiha, dijo que Kiev y sus aliados están listos para un cese del fuego completo e incondicional con Rusia durante al menos 30 días a partir del lunes. Agregó que los cuatro líderes visitantes y Zelenskyy habían tenido una llamada telefónica constructiva con Trump. El sábado fue el último día del cese del fuego unilateral de tres días declarado por Rusia, que, según Ucrania, las fuerzas del Kremlin han violado repetidamente. En marzo, Estados Unidos propuso una tregua inmediata y limitada de 30 días, que Ucrania aceptó, pero el Kremlin ha insistido en términos que le sean más favorables. Fortalecer las capacidades militares de Ucrania será un elemento clave para disuadir a Rusia , dijeron el sábado los líderes europeos. Esto requerirá suministrar a Ucrania cantidades robustas de armas para disuadir futuros ataques e invertir en su sector de defensa. Una fuerza compuesta por tropas extranjeras también podría desplegarse como una medida adicional de tranquilidad, dijo Macron. El presidente francés agregó que Estados Unidos tomará la delantera en la supervisión de un cese del fuego propuesto, con el apoyo de países europeos, y amenazó con sanciones masivas... preparadas y coordinadas entre europeos y estadounidenses, si Rusia viola la tregua. Pero dijo que los detalles sobre posibles despliegues europeos en Ucrania aún se están afinando. No se mencionó la membresía en la OTAN, que sigue siendo la principal opción de Kiev para una garantía de seguridad. La prioridad es hacer que la guerra sea demasiado costosa para que Rusia continúe luchando, dijo Sybiha a los reporteros al margen del evento. El teniente general retirado Keith Kellogg, enviado especial de Trump para Ucrania y Rusia, dijo el sábado que un cese del fuego integral de 30 días, que cubra ataques desde el aire, tierra, mar y sobre infraestructura, iniciará el proceso para poner fin a la guerra más grande y larga en Europa desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Más temprano el sábado, los líderes europeos se unieron a una ceremonia en la Plaza de la Independencia de Kiev para conmemorar el 80mo aniversario del final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Encendieron velas junto a Zelenskyy en un memorial improvisado con banderas en honor a los soldados ucranianos caídos y a los civiles asesinados desde la invasión rusa. Trump ha presionado a ambas partes para llegar rápidamente a un acuerdo para poner fin a la guerra, pero mientras Zelenskyy aceptó el plan estadounidense para una pausa inicial de 30 días en las hostilidades, Rusia no ha firmado. En cambio, ha seguido lanzando ataques a lo largo de los aproximadamente 1.600 kilómetros 1.000 millas del frente, incluyendo operaciones letales en zonas residenciales sin objetivos militares evidentes. El sábado por la mañana, funcionarios de la región de Sumy, en el norte de Ucrania, reportaron que los bombardeos rusos de la víspera mataron a tres residentes e hirieron a otros cuatro. Otro civil murió en el acto el sábado cuando un dron ruso alcanzó la ciudad sureña de Jersón, según el gobernador regional, Oleksandr Prokudin. Hablando con reporteros en Kiev, el presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron, dijo Lo que está sucediendo con Polonia, Alemania y el Reino Unido es un momento histórico para la defensa europea y hacia una mayor independencia para nuestra seguridad. Obviamente para Ucrania, pero también para todos nosotros. Es una nueva era. Es una Europa que se ve a sí misma como una potencia. La semana pasada, Trump señaló que duda que el presidente de Rusia, Vladímir Putin, quiera poner fin a su guerra en Ucrania, expresando un nuevo escepticismo de que se pueda alcanzar un acuerdo de paz pronto, y sugirió más sanciones contra Rusia. El progreso para poner fin a la guerra ha parecido esquivo en los meses desde que Trump regresó a la Casa Blanca, y sus afirmaciones anteriores de avances inminentes no se han materializado. Trump ha presionado en el pasado a Ucrania para ceder territorio a Rusia y poner fin a la guerra, y amenazó con retirarse si el acuerdo se complica, lo que ha hecho sonar las alarmas en Europa acerca de cómo llenar ese vacío. Los aliados europeos de Ucrania ven la guerra como fundamental para la seguridad del continente, por lo que se ha incrementado la presión para encontrar formas de respaldar militarmente a Kiev, con independencia de que la Casa Blanca se retire. ___ El periodista de The Associated Press Thomas Adamson en París contribuyó a este despacho. ___ Esta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.

"Title: Two dolls instead of 30? Toys become the latest symbol of Trumps trade war
Description: Toy dolls have become the latest rhetorical poster child for President Donald Trumps tariffs crusade.

AP PhotoNg Han Guan, File President Donald Trump listens during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. AP PhotoEvan Vucci NEW YORK AP  President Donald Trumps tariffs crusade has taken aim at a number of foreign goods, from European wines and car parts from Mexico to films made abroad. Lately, the presidents wandering ire has found another rhetorical poster child toy dolls. Trump asserted that children will be fine having two dolls  perhaps three or five  instead of 30 if U.S. import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch and photos of a young Barron Trumps child-sized Mercedes convertible. COMPLETELY out of touch, The Loyal Subjects CEO Jonathan Cathey, whose collectible toy company in Los Angeles produces Strawberry Shortcake and Rainbow Brite dolls, wrote on Linkedin. If that aint a Let them eat cake moment shot through the echoes of history? Love how toys and dolls have become THE martyr metaphor for this nonsensical trade war incoherence. The presidents comments also touched a nerve with parents, both ones who took offense at the casual way he hypothesized that perhaps two dolls will cost a couple bucks more and those who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need. Either way, the U.S. toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the tariff standoff between the Trump administration and the government in Beijing. Nearly 80 of the toys sold in the U.S. come from China. The Toy Association, a trade group, has lobbied for an immediate reprieve from the 145 tariff rate the president put on Chinese-made products. Some toy companies warn the likelihood of holiday shortages increases each week the tariff remains in effect. Heres a snapshot of the doll debate and how tariffs are impacting toys From Barbie, Bratz and Cabbage Patch Kids to Adora baby dolls, American Girl and Our Generation, dolls are a big business in the U.S. as well as beloved playthings. The doll category, which includes accessories like clothes, generated U.S. sales of 2.7 billion last year compared to 2.9 billion in 2023 and 3.4 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Consumers splurged on toys during the height of the COVID pandemic to keep children and themselves occupied, but sales flattened as inflation seized the economy. Younger girls becoming more interested in buying makeup and skincare also has cooled the demand for dolls, Marshal Cohen, Circanas chief retail advisor, said. The nations largest toy maker, Mattel, said this week it would have to raise prices for some products sold in the U.S. to offset higher costs related to tariffs. The company, whose brands include Barbie and American Girl, said the increases were necessary even though its speeding up the expansion of its manufacturing base outside of China. Smaller toy companies are expected to have a harder time than Mattel and Hasbro, which makes the eating, drinking and diaper-wetting Baby Alive. Cathey said he paused The Loyal Subjects shipments from China in April because he couldnt pay the stratospheric tariff they would have incurred. Nobody insulates themselves with that much cash, he said. With about four months worth of inventory on hand, Cathey said his ability to secure holiday stock depends on a break in the U.S.-China trade standoff happening in the next two weeks since it would take time for cargo operations to resume. Cepia, a Missouri company that was behind the 2009 holiday season hit Zhu Zhu Pets, launched a line of 11-inch fashion dolls called Decora Girlz last year. CEO James Russell Hornsby said he was working to relocate some production but the move wont happen in time to replace the orders he planned to get from China. Hornsby described himself as a Trump supporter and said he understands the administrations desire to reduce trade imbalances. Lets just get the deals done and stop all this because Trumps disrupting Christmas, he said. Although American Girl launched in 1986 with a line based on fictional historical characters, the dolls never were domestic products. They were made in Germany before production eventually moved to China. Toy experts say that in addition to lower costs, Chinese factories have developed techniques and expertise that are not easily replicated. We dont have any capacity in the U.S. to make rooted doll hair. And then youve got things like the faces. Some of them are hand-painted, others are done with a Tampo printing machine, James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry publication The Toy Book, said of doll-making. Hornsby said rooting the synthetic hair onto the heads of Decora Girlz dolls is carried out by skilled workers at factories in Guangzhou and Dongguan, China. Its not just sticking into a machine and it automatically does it, he said. You have to know what youre doing in order to make that doll look like its got a full set of hair when literally maybe only 60 of the head is filled with hair. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said last week that he assumes consumers would prefer to pay more for American-made products. Dolls made in China might have lead paint in them, he said. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the picture is more complicated. Products for children ages 12 and under require third-party testing and certification from labs approved by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing lead levels in toys, Murray said. The rules apply to all products sold in the U.S. Toys by major brands such as Fisher-Price, Mattel, Hasbro and Lego, which have long outsourced manufacturing to China, are usually in compliance, she said. But the rise of online shopping, including e-commerce platforms that ship directly to U.S. consumers from overseas, has posed a challenge, according to Murray. When valued at less than 800, such parcels entered the U.S. duty-free and were not subject to the same scrutiny as bulk imports, she said. The White House eliminated the customs exemption starting May 2 for low-value parcels that originated in mainland China and Hong Kong. U.S Customs and Border Protection expects additional oversight will make it easier to flag problems. Toy companies and industry experts argue the high tariffs on Chinese imports will tempt price-sensitive shoppers to search for cheap counterfeit toys that carry higher safety risks. Plenty of people agree American consumer culture has gotten out of hand, in large part due to prices kept low through the labor of foreign factory workers who earn much less than they would in the U.S. Katie Walley-Wiegert, 38, a senior marketer in Richmond, Virginia, and the parent of a 2-year-old son, agrees theres too much materialism but thinks parents should have choices when deciding what is best for their children. She found the wealthy Trumps comments off-putting. I think it is a small view of what purchase habits and realities are for people who buy toys for kids, Walley-Wiegert said. San Francisco resident Elenor Mak, who founded the Jilly Bing doll company after she couldnt find an Asian American doll for her daughter, Jillian, now 5, said the presidents remarks upset her because some families struggle to buy even one doll. The trade war with China just makes it even more impossible for those families, Mak said. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",1
"Title: Hong Kong security law informers Were in every corner, watching
Description: Ex-banker Innes Tang has established a hotline for reporting behaviours deemed disloyal to Beijing.
Content: From a woman waving a colonial-era flag in a shopping mall, to bakery staff selling cakes with protest symbols on them - dozens of Hongkongers have been reported to the police by one man for what he believes were national security violations. Were in every corner of society, watching, to see if there is anything suspicious which could infringe on the national security law, former banker Innes Tang tells the BBC World Service. If we find these things, we go and report it to the police. When the UK returned Hong Kong to China 28 years ago, internationally binding treaties guaranteed the citys rights and freedoms for 50 years. But the national security law NSL, imposed by Beijing a year after Hong Kongs 2019 mass pro-democracy protests, has been criticised for scuttling free speech and press, and for ushering in a new culture of informing. The law criminalises activities considered to be calls for secession breaking away from China, subversion undermining the power or authority of the government, and collusion with foreign forces. An additional security law called Article 23, voted in last year, has further tightened restrictions. With new laws and arrests, there has been limited reporting on Hong Kongs pro-China patriots - the people who are now running and policing the city, as well as the ordinary citizens who openly support them. But the BBC has spent weeks interviewing Innes Tang, 60, a prominent self-described patriot. He and his volunteers have taken screen grabs from social media of any activities or comments they believe could be in breach of the NSL. He also established a hotline for tip-offs from the public and encouraged his online followers to share information on the people around them. Nearly 100 individuals and organisations have been reported to the authorities by him and his followers, he says. Does reporting work? We wouldnt do it if it didnt, Mr Tang says. Many had cases opened by the police with some resulting in jail terms. Mr Tang says he hasnt investigated alleged law breakers himself, but simply reported incidents he thinks warrant scrutiny - describing it as proper community-police co-operation. Mr Tang is not the only so-called patriot to engage in this kind of surveillance. Hong Kongs authorities have set up their own national security hotline, receiving 890,000 tip-offs from November 2020 to February this year - the citys security bureau told the BBC. For those who are reported to the authorities, pressure can be relentless. Since the NSL was enacted in 2020, up until February this year, more than 300 people had been arrested for national security offences. And an estimated 300,000 or more Hongkongers have permanently left the city in recent years. Pong Yat-ming, the owner of an independent bookshop that hosts public talks, says he often receives inspections from government departments which cite anonymous complaints. He received 10 visits in one 15-day period, he says. Kenneth Chan, political scientist and university lecturer, who has been involved in the citys pro-democracy movement since the 1990s, jokes he has become a bit radioactive these days. Some friends, students and colleagues now keep their distance because of his outspoken views, he says. But I would be the last person to blame the victims. Its the system. In response, Hong Kongs government said it attaches great importance to upholding academic freedom and institutional autonomy. But it adds that academic institutions have the responsibility to ensure their operations are in compliance with the law and meet the interests of the community at large. Innes Tang says he is motivated to report people by a love of Hong Kong, and that his views on China were cultivated when he was young, when the city was still a British colony. The colonial policies werent really that great, he says. The best opportunities were always given to the British and we the locals did not really have access. Like many of his generation, he nursed a longing to be united with China and taken out of colonial governance. But he says many other Hongkongers at the time were more concerned with their livelihoods than their rights. Democracy or freedom. These were all very abstract ideas which we didnt really understand, he says. An average citizen should not become too involved in politics, he says, explaining he only became politically active to restore what he calls balance to Hong Kong society following the turbulence of 2019. He is giving a voice, he says, to what he calls the silent majority of Hongkongers who do not support independence from China, nor the disruption created by the protests. Outside of the UK - watch on YouTube But other Hongkongers consider rallies and demonstrations a longstanding tradition, and one of the only ways to voice public opinion in a city that now does not have a fully democratically elected leadership. We are no longer a city of protests, says Kenneth Chan, who specialises in Eastern European politics. So what are we? I dont have the answer yet. And patriotism isnt inherently a negative thing, he says. It is a value, maybe even a virtue, he argues, although it needs to allow citizens to keep a critical distance - something that is not happening in Hong Kong. Electoral reform was pushed through in 2021 - stating that only patriots who swore loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party could hold important positions in government or the Legislative Council LegCo - Hong Kongs parliament. As a result, the council struggles to function, believes Hong Kong-based China commentator Lew Mon-hung, a former member of the Chinese government advisory body, the CPPCC. The public think a lot of these patriots are verbal revolutionaries or political opportunists - they dont really represent the people, he says. Thats why ridiculous policies still pass with a huge majority. There is no-one to constrain or oppose, no-one to scrutinise. Even patriot Innes Tang says he wants to see the current system challenged. I dont want to see every policy passing with 90 of the vote, he tells the BBC. There is a danger the National Security Law will be weaponised, he says, with people saying If you dont agree with me, I accuse you of infringement of the national security law. I dont agree with this type of stuff, says Mr Tang. Hong Kongs government said The improved LegCo is now rid of extremists who wish to obstruct and even paralyse the operation of the government without any intention of entering into constructive dialogue to represent the interests of all Hong Kong people. For now, says Mr Tang, he has stopped reporting on people. Balance and stability, he believes, has returned to Hong Kong. The number of large-scale protests has dwindled to none at all. In academia, fear of surveillance - and how life might change for someone who infringes the laws - means self-censorship and censorship have become the order of the day, says Kenneth Chan. Pro-democracy parties are no longer represented in the Legislative Council and many have disbanded - including the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, once the most powerful party. Innes Tang has now set his sights overseas. There arent any particular issues in Hong Kong now, so I asked myself - shouldnt I have a look at how I can continue to serve my community and my country? he says. For a non-politician and civilian like me, this is an invaluable opportunity. He now works as a representative for one of several pro-Beijing non-profit groups, regularly visiting the UN in Geneva to speak at conventions giving Chinas perspective on Hong Kong, human rights and other issues. Mr Tang is also in the process of establishing a media company in Switzerland, and registering as a member of the press. For Kenneth Chan in Hong Kong, his future hangs in the balance. One third of my friends and students are now in exile, another third of my friends and students are in jail, and Im sort of in limbo, he says. Today Im speaking freely with you no-one would promise me that I would continue doing it for the rest of my life. In a written reply to the BBC, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said that national security is a top priority and inherent right for any country. It only targets an extremely small minority of people and organisations that pose a threat to national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public. Anna Kwoks father and brother have been accused of helping the US-based pro-democracy activist with her finances, local media report. They were part of the Hong Kong 47 who tried to run an unofficial election primary. Party leader Sir Ed Davey urges the foreign secretary to summon the Chinese ambassador for an explanation. The citys leader says Lee made significant contributions to Hong Kongs prosperity. Once Hong Kongs largest opposition party, the Democratic Party has suffered since Chinas crackdown.

"Title: Nigerian Doctor Who fan thrilled show is finally coming to Lagos
Description: The Doctor will be transported to Lagos in the first ever episode set primarily in an African country.
Content: Whatever I was doing - maybe cleaning up or doing homework - when I heard the oooh-oooh-oooooh, Adesoji Kukoyi says, mimicking the iconic Doctor Who theme tune, I dropped everything and ran straight to the television. As a child growing up in 1980s Nigeria, Mr Kukoyi was infatuated with sci-fi sensation Doctor Who. British shows like Allo Allo and Fawlty Towers aired regularly as a cultural hangover from the colonial era, but none captured Mr Kukoyis imagination like the time-travelling Doctor did. He always spoke to me, 44-year-old Mr Kukoyi, who currently has a vintage Doctor Who theme as the ringtone on his phone, tells the BBC. Like theres somebody watching out for us... yes, we make mistakes, but we do our best, especially if we have a teacher that will lead us on the right path. Mr Kukoyi has been watching Doctor Who for decades, so when he heard that on Saturday an episode will, for the very first time, be set in Nigeria, he was elated. I was watching last weeks episode with my wife and the preview for the following week said Welcome to Lagos, Nigeria. I screamed like a little girl! Mr Kukoyi says. The setting is momentous not just for Mr Kukoyi - a native of Nigerias biggest and liveliest city Lagos - but for the show too. Saturdays adventure will be the first primarily set in Africa. It is fitting that the producers chose Nigeria for this milestone - in 2013, fans worldwide were delighted when nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s were unearthed in a Nigerian TV facility. Ariyon Bakare, who in the upcoming episode plays the mysterious Barber, says fans can expect a time-bending cultural ancestral collision and hair, lots of hair. The preview also teases a vibrant barber shop, a brimming Lagos market and a towering, monstrous-looking spider. Fans speculate that this creature is Anansi, a legendary character in West African and Caribbean folktales, but scriptwriter Inua Ellams is keeping specifics under wraps. As for why the show has enjoyed such popularity in Nigeria, he says Theres something Nigerian about the Doctor. Nigerians are sort of loud, gregarious people... the Doctor is mysterious, boisterous, sort of over-confident but somehow manages to save the day. Ellams, who moved from Nigeria to the UK as a child, also considers why in 62 years, a character known to traverse the universe has barely spent any time in Africa. It could be that no writer has felt confident enough to produce an authentic African story, he says, or it might be down to the Doctors need to blend into his environment and be inconspicuous. Ncuti Gatwa who plays the Doctor being an actor of African descent means that we can tell new stories with the Doctor and negotiate in different spaces because of his appearance. And this is the brilliance of the show - every Doctor creates new opportunities to tell new stories in different ways, Ellams tells the BBC. But these fresh Doctor Who stories have a smaller reach than the old ones did, as the show is no longer broadcast on Nigerian public TV. If you are in the country and want to catch up on the Doctors exploits, you would have to subscribe to streaming service Disney Plus. Regardless, Mr Kukoyi insists that a dedicated troop of Nigerian Doctor Who lovers will be sitting transfixed on their sofas on Saturday evening, bearing witness to the Tardis materialising in Lagos. Im waiting with baited breath, he says. Finally, he is coming! Mr Kukoyi - whose first experience of the Doctor was one played by a stripy scarf-wearing Tom Baker - says his young daughters are not so taken with his beloved show. He is trying to get them onboard, he says. Perhaps seeing the Doctor wearing traditional Nigerian clothing, squeezing his way through a quintessential Lagos market and getting caught up in local folklore will help them fall in love with the show the way their father once did.

"Title: Eurovision Irish entry EMMY ready for lift-off with Laika Party
Description: The contest, which is hosted by the EBU, will begin on 13 May in Basel, Switzerland with the final on 17 May.
Content: Thirty years ago Irish violinist Fionnuala Sherry helped win the Eurovision Song Contest for Norway - could an astro-dog themed favour be returned this year? Enter EMMY, who will be flying the Irish tricolour in Basel, Switzerland, next week. But how does a 24-year-old Norwegian singer, who had never been to Ireland, end up representing one of Eurovisions most decorated nations? As it turns out, quite easily - after a chance encounter at a songwriting camp in her native Scandinavia, where she met Irish songwriter Larissa Tormey. The pair collaborated on the song Laika Party - inspired by the stray Soviet dog who was sent on a doomed space mission in 1957. The dog, described as a female Russian breed, became the first living creature to orbit the Earth when she was launched aboard the space satellite Sputnik II. She died after 10 hours due to overheating and stress, but EMMY and her co-writers have imagined a different outcome in their bizarre, upbeat ode to Laika. So far, so Eurovision. Ive heard her story since I was a little kid, but it came to me again as an adult and I thought about how extremely sad her story really is. I wanted to create a scenario where she gets to be happy and alive instead, EMMY said. After initially being rejected from the Norwegian Eurovision selection process, Laika Party was given a second chance when it was announced as an entry for Irelands Eurosong. Larissa said she thought this song would fit Ireland, because of their love for animals... we decided to submit it and Im so glad we did, she explained. Evidently, they were right - the song succeeded over the likes of Irish pop royalty Samantha Mumba, who was left unimpressed by the selection process, and will make its Eurovision debut at the second semi-final on 15 May. Eurosong was actually my first time in Ireland, EMMY said. We had about a week to become as Irish as we could! Im so grateful that Ireland actually chose us, you know, its just an amazing journey and we have done these pre-parties around Europe and its so amazing to see the audience sing along, that means a lot. However, speaking to BBC News NI ahead of the competition, EMMY acknowledged some of the controversies swirling this years event. Last year, 2024 winner Nemo criticised organisers for not doing enough to support contestants amid tensions over Israels participation. Likewise Irelands Bambie Thug - who secured sixth place, the countrys best result since 2000 - protested Israels involvement, due to the humanitarian cost of the countrys war on Hamas. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage during the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war. At least 52,600 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Against this backdrop, tensions emerged backstage during last years Eurovision in Malmö, Sweden. Bambie Thug accused Israels national broadcaster, Kan, of inciting violence against them while other participants accused the Israeli delegation of filming them and posting clips online without their permission. Kan, meanwhile, said the Israeli delegation had faced an unprecedented display of hatred. The European Broadcasting Union EBU acknowledged that several contestants lodged complaints and has since implemented a new code of conduct and duty of care protocol. These include designated no-filming zones in artist areas, more private rehearsals and better schedules to enhance participants welfare. But the controversy has rumbled on - more than 70 former Eurovision contestants have signed an open letter, urging organisers to ban Israel from this years event. Meanwhile, Irelands national broadcaster RTÉ has asked the EBU to discuss Israels inclusion in the competition, with its director general Kevin Bakhurst saying he was appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East. This led to speculation RTÉ may pull Irelands entry - and EMMY - out of the competition altogether, a move ruled out by Mr Bakhurst when he said he did not want to undermine Israels public service broadcaster. That confirmation may come as a relief to EMMY, who told BBC News NI she is so grateful to represent the Emerald Isle at this years competition and cannot wait to see what Basel has in store for her. As for any controversial issues, the singer said she feels well supported as she prepares for the upcoming semi-final. Everybody that was involved last year theyve experienced it now, and maybe the EBU have learned from it and theres some new rules to keep everyone happy, safe and satisfied, she said. I feel that people around me are taking good care of me, so Im just very excited. The UKs Eurovision entry for 2025 will be the female country-pop trio Remember Monday. The group of school friends, who previously reached the quarter-finals of The Voice, will head to Switzerland with a song called What The Hell Just Happened? Laika Party lifts off during Eurovision Semi-Final 2 at 2000 BST on 15 May. You can follow along live on BBC One and on the BBC iPlayer. It comes after a free beachfront concert by the rapper was cancelled last minute. With just a week to go, heres our guide to the songs and artists taking part in Eurovision 2025. They are among 400 artists appealing to Sir Keir Starmer, saying creative industries are threatened.

"Title: Rumeysa Ozturk Turkish Tufts University student released on bail
Description: Her arrest followed the White Houses crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses.
Content: Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk has been released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana, hours after a federal judge ordered her to be freed. Thank you so much. I am a little bit tired, so I will take some time to rest, she told reporters and supporters who were crowded outside the facility. US District Judge William Sessions said the student met all the conditions needed for release and lambasted the governments case against her. Ms Otzurk, a doctoral student from Turkey, co-authored an opinion piece in her campus newspaper that was critical of Israels war. Her arrest follows the White Houses crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses. Her continued detention chills the speech of millions in this country who are not citizens, the judge said on Friday as he ordered her release. Ms Ozturk walked out of the detention facility after six weeks in custody and was greeted by cheers and with her hands on her heart. She had been detained since March, when US immigration officials arrested her on the streets in Massachusetts. Videos of the arrest showed masked plain-clothes officers surrounding her after a Ramadan celebration, handcuffing her and then taking her into an unmarked car. Her detention sparked nationwide protests. The US Department of Homeland Security had accused Ms Ozturk of engaging in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organisation that relishes the killing of Americans. After the judges ruling, a DHS spokesperson responded Visas provided to foreign students to live and study in the United States are a privilege not a right. The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and common sense to our immigration system, and will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country. Earlier this week, the judge ordered that Ms Ozturk be transferred by 14 May to immigration authorities in Vermont, where she was last held before she was moved to Louisiana. On Friday, Judge Sessions said that she should be released immediately without travel restrictions, so she can go to Vermont or Massachusetts, where Tufts is located, as needed. He heard from a number of witnesses in the case, including Ms Ozturk, her doctor and a Tufts University professor. The government did not call any witnesses during Fridays hearing. During her testimony, which she offered virtually, Ms Ozturk told the court about her Fulbright scholarship and her PhD work. She said her asthma had worsened during her detention, and at one point she had to take a short break after suffering an asthma attack on camera. Judge Sessions said Ms Ozturk had raised very substantial claims that her First Amendment right to free speech and her due process rights were violated. He said the only evidence the administration had against Ms Ozturk was her op-ed. That literally is the case, he said, according to court reporters. There is no evidence that she has engaged in violence or advocated violence. In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU, which is representing Ms Ozturk, said they were delighted by her release. Rümeysa can now return to her beloved Tufts community, resume her studies, and begin teaching again, said Noor Zafar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. Todays ruling underscores a vital First Amendment principle no one should be imprisoned by the government for expressing their beliefs. A spokesman for Tufts said the university is pleased with the judges ruling, adding We look forward to welcoming her back to campus to resume her doctoral studies. The Trump administration has detained several international students - some legal residents - who have organised in support of the Palestinians. Last week, a judge ordered the government to release Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi after immigration officials detained him during a naturalisation interview. The 34-year-old permanent resident was raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and had been held at a facility in Vermont. One of the highest profile cases thus far involves Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent pro-Palestinian activist, who remains in a Louisiana detention facility without charges. Miller comments come as judges have sought to challenge some recent detentions made by the Trump administration in an effort to combat illegal immigration The White House is actively looking at suspending the legal right to challenge detention.

"Title: Doagh Famine Village Donegal community effort to rebuild visitor attraction
Description: Mr Doherty and his family work seven days a week at the attraction, and hope to reopen in the summer.
Content: When a fire ripped through part of the Doagh Famine Village in Donegal last Saturday, owner Pat Doherty said he was devastated and considered giving up on it all. But after an outpouring of community support, donations and volunteering, work is underway to rebuild and restore one of Donegals most popular tourist attractions. The fire, which broke out last Saturday was put out and foul play is not suspected. The original Doagh Famine Village tells the story of an Irish family living through famine times up until the present day. Until 1984, Mr Doherty lived with his family in one of the thatched dwellings, which is now on display, and he decided to make it a tourist attraction in 1997. Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Doherty said the fire started way beyond the famine village, in an outbuilding, where it seems a compressor machine had overheated. Due to dry weather and a strong wind, the fire spread quickly to the newer extension to the attraction. While most of the village is to do with the famine, we had another part which was to do with the Peace Process and the Traveller community, those were the parts destroyed by the fire. However the original part of the village is intact. Mr Doherty said many things which were destroyed are now lost to history. We had an original gypsy wagon, that belonged to a family from Letterkenny which cannot be replaced, ever. There was an Orange Hall that was constructed as part of the attraction which many lodges from all over Northern Ireland had donated to because they wanted their stories told. Despite the irreparable damage caused, Mr Doherty said the power of the community and good will has spurred him to rebuild. We will have to rebuild and hope that we can get the stories back, and it might be a bit different, but maybe better the second time round, he added. The people who helped us before, the Orange Order, and the republican side too, they are still there, and they want their stories told here. Its all for peace - I have not met a loyalist or a republican who doesnt want the world to be a better place, he added. A construction company has volunteered to clear the damaged area of the site so the rebuild can begin, and Mr Doherty hopes he can reopen the family-run business by the end of the summer. Mr Doherty described it as strange, in a good way, the degree of goodwill that has poured in from the people and businesses of Donegal. A nearby visitor attraction called Wild Alpaca Way began a crowd funder which raised most of its 100k 84,000 target within a few days. One lad who had his 17th birthday gave most of his birthday money as a donation, its very strange. A wee local shop donated 2,000 1,692 of its earnings, he added. Another outdoor tourist attraction from Donegal presented Mr Doherty with a 10,000 8,462 cheque earlier in the week. We depend on other places, one attraction depends on another in Donegal, they all work together, he added. Because many of the structures in the attraction featured traditional thatched rooves, Mr Doherty said the insurance does not cover fire damage. Donegal County Fire Service said Fire Brigades from Buncrana, Carndonagh and Moville had attended the incident. Although a number of important exhibits were lost in the fire, the thatched cottages and other key buildings were protected from the fire, a spokesperson said. Brigades remained at the scene until after 2100 local time on the evening of the incident. Gardaí Irish police also assisted and said a technical examination of the scene has been completed. The London City Lionesses player set the new record at 37.55m, over two metres further than the original record of 35m. Bath Fashion Museum closed in 2022 with its collection stored in a glove factory in Wiltshire. The director of Eurovision said no participating EBU member had publicly opposed Israeli broadcaster Kans participation. The Irish government expects domestic economy to expand by 2.5 this year, down from an earlier forecast of 2.9.

"Title: Watch Trump misspeaks and calls toy firm Mattel a country

Content: Donald Trump has accidentally called toy firm Mattel a country while threatening further tariffs. The US president misspoke when saying tariffs are misunderstood in business.

"Title: Trump administration considering suspending habeas corpus
Description: The White House is actively looking at suspending the legal right to challenge detention.
Content: Donald Trumps administration is actively looking at suspending habeas corpus - the right of a person to challenge their detention in court - one of the US presidents top aides has said. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, told reporters on Friday that the US Constitution allowed for the legal liberty to be suspended in times of rebellion or invasion. His comments come as judges have sought to challenge some recent detentions made by the Trump administration in an effort to combat illegal immigration, as well as remove dissenting foreign students. A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not, Miller said. There are several pending civil cases against the Trump administrations deportation of undocumented migrants based on habeaus corpus. Most recently, a federal judge ordered the release of a Turkish university student who had been detained for six weeks after writing an article that was critical of Israel. Last week, another judge ordered a Columbia University student detained over his advocacy for Palestinians be released after a petition on habeas corpus grounds. However, other judges have sided with the Trump administration in such disputes. Miller described habeas corpus as a privilege, and said Congress had already passed a law stripping judicial courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases. Legal experts and critics have questioned the veracity of his interpretation of US law. Congress has the authority to suspend habeas corpus - not Stephen Miller, not the president, Marc Elias, an attorney for the Democratic Party, told MSNBC. One of Trumps key campaign pledges was to deport millions of immigrants from the US, and his administration has pursued different means of expediting deportations since returning to the White House. In March, a federal judges order prevented the Trump administration from invoking a centuries-old wartime law to justify deporting more than 200 Venezuelans, despite the flights going ahead. But deportations have lagged behind detentions - while one person has been deported erroneously. CNN reported, citing unnamed sources, that Trump was personally involved in the discussions around suspending habeas corpus. Trump himself has not mentioned the suspension of habeas corpus, but has said he would take steps to combat injunctions against his actions on deportation. There are ways to mitigate it and theres some very strong ways, he said in April. Theres one way thats been used by three very highly respected presidents, but we hope we dont have to go that route. Habeas corpus - which literally means you should have the body - allows for a person to be brought before a judge so the legality of their detention can be decided by a judge. The legal right has been suspended four times in US history during the American Civil War under Abraham Lincoln, in Hawaii following the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour, in the Philippines during US ownership in 1905, and while combat the activities of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group in the 19th Century. The section of the US Constitution which includes the suspension of habeas corpus grants its powers to Congress and not the president. How consumers are reacting to shipping changes that mean low-value packages entering the US no longer avoid tariffs. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was among Democratic officials seeking to enter the facility. Her arrest followed the White Houses crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses.

"Title: Pope Leo XIV First days may yield clues to leadership style
Description: Scrutiny about the way the latest pope might run the Catholic Church started the moment he stepped on to the balcony.
Content: Not long after greeting crowds from the balcony overlooking St Peters Square on Thursday evening, Pope Leo XIV returned to the SantUffizio Palace, where he had been living for the last two months. He was met by a jubilant group of staff and former colleagues, all eager to shake his hand and congratulate him. A young girl handed him a Bible to bless and sign. Of course, though I have to try out my new signature, Pope Leo said with a smile. The old one is of no use anymore. He had only stopped being Robert Francis Prevost a few hours before, when he was elected pope. As he took on the name Leo XIV, a new life began for the 69-year-old Chicago-born cardinal. But details on how Pope Leo will be looking to run the Catholic Church are still scarce, and so over the next few days and weeks every small clue  from his attire to his choice of accommodation  will be examined. Scrutiny began as soon as he stepped on to the balcony, giving the crowd a glimpse of the vestments he chose for his first appearance. The gold cross around his neck that caught the evening light was seen as a first sign he was departing from the simplicity of his predecessors simple silver pendant the embroidered stole and red mozzetta cemented that impression. Then, the fact that the homily he delivered to cardinals in the Sistine Chapel on Friday morning was scripted  rather than improvised  also sent a signal that Leo will be more closely aligned to tradition than Francis was, said Austen Ivereigh, a Catholic writer and commentator. But several events over the next few days and weeks will give Pope Leo a further chance to sketch out the priorities of his pontificate. On Monday he is due to hold an audience with the media and on 18 May he will celebrate a solemn inaugural mass in St Peters Square. As part of that mass he will deliver a homily in the presence of numerous heads of state and dignitaries. In his 2013 inaugural homily, Pope Francis asked all those who have positions of responsibility in economic, political and social life to be protectors of creation, of Gods plan of one another and of the environment. So that moment might also provide clues about the matters dearest to Pope Leos heart. The new Popes choice of accommodation too will be significant. Francis made the choice of choosing to live in the simple Casa Santa Marta guesthouse, which was seen as revolutionary, but Leo may well decide to follow in the footsteps of virtually all his predecessors and reside in the grand Apostolic Palace. He was elected less than a day ago lets give him time to decide, Vatican sources quoted by Italian media said. These are all important choices, Ivereigh added. Over the next few days well be learning more and more about it  the first week of the pontificate is a constant revelation. Meanwhile, in the absence of details about his future as Leo XIV, fragments of the Popes old life as Robert Prevost are emerging from around the world. This is the case especially in his native Chicago and his adopted homeland of Peru, of which he became a citizen in 2015. In one photo, he is presented with a large handmade birthday card written in Spanish and surrounded by cakes and balloons. A video recorded when he left Peru for Rome, in which he says he would miss the joy of Peru and staples of local cuisine like ceviche, has been met with triumph by South American social media users. The pope is Peruvian God loves Peru, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said. American tourists ambling in St Peters Square on the day after the election were more restrained, and a bit frazzled by the news that the new Pope is from the US. Im still surprised they chose an American, to be honest, said Chicagoan Kerry, who is in Rome on her honeymoon. She admitted she didnt yet know much about the new Pope but was pleased by rumours that he is a fan of the White Sox baseball team. Asked how she thought Pope Leo felt today, she laughed He must be really overwhelmed I bet he didnt sleep a wink! Her husband Joseph agreed When youre elected Pope you come here as a cardinal for the conclave but then things never go back to the way they were, he said. But he felt like the new Pope seemed to be a man of confidence, prayer and humility. I just pray that he shows the world what being a man of God can do. The newly-weds posed for a picture with the days newspapers, then wandered off into St Peters Square, resplendent in the spring sunshine. Retired Bishop Michael Campbell remembers the day the future pontiff visited Lancaster in 2008. Pope Leo XIV has supported his predecessor and focus will turn on whether he continues Church reforms. Born in the Windy City in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. Anna Rowlands says the pontiff was slightly overwhelmed, but his serenity was also intensified. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford welcomes the election of the first Pope from the United States.

"Title: Visit the Arctic vault holding back-ups of great works
Description: An arctic vault holds digital back-ups of some of humanitys great works of art, history and technology.
Content: High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. Frozen, mountainous, and remote, its home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements. One of those is Longyearbyen, the worlds northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive AWA - an underground vault for data. Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years. This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. Thats our mission, says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside. Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archives metal door. Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored. Its a lot of memories, a lot of heritage, Mr Bjerkestrand says. Its anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it. Since the archives launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries. Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library satellite observations of Earth from space and Norways treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck. The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads. It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank thats located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters. Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data, said Mr Bjerkstand. There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers. According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility. Its far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer! Underground its dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries. Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says. At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHubs Code Vault. The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps. Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here. Its incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, its become so critical to our day to day lives, Githhubs chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC. His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them. At Piqls headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film. Data is a sequence of bits and bytes, explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips. We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image or frame is about eight million pixels. Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, its similar to a mass of tiny QR codes. The information cant be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev. We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film. One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future. Thats a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well. Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential digital Dark Age, as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete. That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past. Many firms offer long-term data storage. Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO Linear Tape Open, are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information. For example, Microsofts Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers. Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome. Thats also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria. The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault. Photographer, Christian Clauwers, whos been documenting South Pacific Islands threatened by sea level rise, was also adding his work. I deposited footage and photography, visual witnesses of the Marshall Islands, he says. The highest point of the island is three meters, and theyre facing huge impact of climate change. It was really humbling and surreal, says archivist Joanne Shortland, head of Heritage Collections at the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust, after depositing records, engineers drawings and photographs of historic car models. I have all these formats that are becoming obsolete. You need to keep changing the file format and making sure that its accessible in 20 or 30, years time. The digital world has so many problems. The meeting is the strongest sign yet that the worlds two biggest economies are ready to de-escalate their trade war. It will leave a 10 import tax on most goods shipped from the UK to the US. The UK government has been seeking an agreement to lower tariffs since Trump imposed levies on almost every country in the world last month.

"Title: Kosmos 482 Soviet spacecraft will likely fall to Earth this week
Description: The spacecraft was meant to go to Venus but has been stuck in orbit for more than 50 years.
Content: Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is expected to crash back to Earth this Saturday after being stuck in orbit for over half a century. Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, failed to escape low Earth orbit and broke into four pieces, according to Nasa. One fragment - likely the lander - will re-enter Earths atmosphere and a part of it could survive without burning up. The European Space Agency predicts the re-entry will happen at around 0916 BST on 10 May, though this could vary by several hours. There is much we dont know about the re-entry, including where it might land, but if any of it does survive, 70 of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to cause significant damage. Its much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris. said Mr Stijn Lemmens, Senior Space Debris Mitigation Analyst at the European Space Agency. The lander capsule is a tough, spherical object about a metre wide and weighs nearly half a tonne. It was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venuss atmosphere, meaning it has a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may survive an uncontrolled descent through Earths atmosphere. The parachute system, originally intended to slow the landers descent towards Venus, is likely long since degraded after more than 50 years in space. The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsules projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7 north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world. This means it could potentially land anywhere from as far north as London to as far south as the southern tip of South America. Uncontrolled space debris incidents have occurred before. Mr Lemmens explained that the re-entry of human-made objects into Earths atmosphere occurs quite frequently, happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earths atmosphere before they reach the ground. Chinas Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018. Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies. Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries. This allows for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas, thereby protecting people and property while managing the environmental impact of space debris.

"Title: The surprising power of breathing through your nose
Description: Every part of my life seemed to improve after nasal surgery, from my allergies to my mental health. Nose breathing is a superpower hidden in plain sight, writes Thomas Germain.
Content: It felt like every part of my life improved after a recent nasal surgery, from my allergies to my mental health. That may not be a coincidence. Nose breathing is a superpower hidden on the front of your face. For as long as I can remember, each breath felt like preparing for a swim underwater, a hard suck of air that never quite filled my lungs. Often Id walk around with a faint whistle in my nose, praying that no one could hear it. The worst problem was a minor disability that most people refused to believe was real something about the cruel architecture of my face made it physically impossible to blow my nose. The world was a constant sniffle. Life cursed me with a deviated septum. My right nostril was blocked on the best of days, and Id wind up breathing through my mouth at the slightest hint of allergies. The nasal troubles even contributed to my sleep apnoea, a breathing condition that makes you wake up multiple times at night, which apparently leaves you more likely to die of any cause. But after decades of unpleasantness, my doctor suggested surgery. The plan was to straighten my septum and reduce my turbinates  bony structures covered in a mucous membrane that condition the air as you breathe  nasal tissues that I didnt even know I had. I was ready to try anything, so on 3 January 2025, I went under the knife. One month of healing later, I was the proud owner of a newly functional nose. I was able to breathe clear and deep out of both nostrils for the very first time. I learned that blowing your nose is an ecstatic pleasure, one I now enjoy as often as possible. And though my sleep apnoea wasnt cured, it did improve. The procedure probably led to a variety of other blessings, too. It turns out there are some surprising benefits to breathing out of your nose, and you dont necessarily need surgery to enjoy them. In fact, nose breathing might even improve your mental health. The most obvious benefit to nasal breathing comes from those turbinates, according to Jacquelyn Callander, an ear, nose and throat doctor at the University of California, San Francisco. Theyre kind of our primary mediator for warming and humidifying air, and thats incredibly important. But they also act as a filtration system, Callander says. Together with your nose hairs, your hard working turbinates sift through dust, bacteria, viruses and more, an advantage you wont get from breathing through your mouth. They can be the first line of defence for your immune system, she says. Its not just the merits of nose breathing to consider, however. Breathing through your mouth has consequences. Theres a lot of research that associates mouth breathing with oral health problems, says Ann Kearney, a speech-language pathologist at Stanford University Medical Center who studies sleep and swallowing issues. Mouth breathing has been shown to increase acidity and dryness in the mouth, linking it to cavities, demineralisation of the teeth and gum disease. A growing body of research also suggests mouth breathing as a child can affect the development of your teeth and jaw, leading to crooked teeth and even changing the shape of your face. Its simple. Your nose is for breathing and your mouth is for eating, Kearney says. For some people with seriously deviated septums or other nasal obstruction, nose breathing isnt an option. But she says a lot of mouth breathers can choose the nasal route in many circumstances. It may not be comfortable at first. The shift from mouth to nasal breathing can be an adjustment, But, Kearney says, the perks kick in with each breath. Most healthy people breathe through their noses when they sleep, but some open their mouths in a nocturnal quest for air. Thats bad news, Kearney says. Its about the position of the tongue. Kearney says you can get a feel for this yourself. When your mouth is closed youre more likely to keep the tip of your tongue pressed to the roof of your mouth and the back of your tongue relaxed, opening up your airway. But stop reading for a second, let your mouth hang open and slacken the muscles in your face. Youll probably notice your tongue rolls towards your throat, especially if you lean your head back. That can restrict the airflow and cause some obstruction, Kearney says. You might even hear something that sounds like snoring if you breathe as you try this. People with obstructed noses tend to breathe through their mouths when they sleep, a phenomenon that often contributes to sleep apnoea. The condition affects an estimated one billion people, as much as 50 of the population in some countries. At best, sleep apnoea worsens your quality of life. At worst, its effects may be as dramatic as an early death. Even if you dont have sleep apnoea, nighttime mouth breathing can cause snoring and all the drawbacks described above. But across the internet, health and wellness influencers are raving about a controversial remedy for this problem mouth tape. Its exactly what it sounds like. You use a piece of tape to keep your mouth shut or even completely sealed. In theory, this forces you to breathe through your nose while you sleep. However, some experts warn there are serious risks to consider. Kearney swears by mouth tape but says it may make breathing more difficult for some people. The only way to know if youre one of them is to see a doctor  do not try this at home without seeking advice from a medical professional first. If you snore, have difficulty breathing through your nose or have any reason to think you might have sleep apnoea, you need to see an ENT ear, nose and throat doctor, she says. The risks of mouth tape Some people breath through their mouths when theyre asleep, which can be an indication of a serious medical condition such as obstructive sleep apnoea. Tape that forces you to breathe through your nose could help certain people  but so far, there hasnt been enough research, and it could make problems worse in some cases. If people have moderate or severe sleep apnoea, those episodes where you open your mouth to breath at night are probably important for returning their oxygen levels back to normal, and I usually advise them not to try mouth tape, says Jacquelyn Callander, an ear, nose and throat doctor at the University of California, San Francisco. There are a lot of patients who have no idea that they have a problem, she says, so its important to see a doctor before you try tape. The practice of mouth taping is still in its infancy. Many ear, nose and throat doctors say there hasnt been enough research into its efficacy or safety. A few early studies suggest it might be helpful, though none are definitive. For example, one study of 20 people in Taiwan found mouth tape significantly improved sleep apnoea and snoring, but the researchers said the small sample size and lack of a control group limited their conclusions. So far we dont have great objective evidence that mouth tape helps decrease sleep apnoea or improves breathing at night, Callander says. But its low-cost and may be beneficial. She believes that mouth taping shows real promise, but agrees it calls for medical advice. If youre thinking of trying it, step one is to talk to a sleep specialist or an ENT. What you can try, however, is nose strips that hold your nostrils open from the outside, Callander says. Some people have whats called nasal valve collapse, where inhaling causes negative pressure in your nasal cavity. For those people, nasal strips can help. Some people even wear them while they exercise. However, if you have a deviated septum or enlarged turbinates, like I did, nose strips probably wont help, she says. Over time, weve gained an increasing understanding of nose breathings physical benefits, but the connection between the nose and the brain is often overlooked. In my case, the simple act of breathing through my nose brought a variety of bodily relief, but the way we breathe, particularly through the nose, can have a surprising impact on our psychological wellbeing. You can think of the nose like a wind chime for the mind when air moves through your nose, it seems to have a significant influence on your cognitive processes. Nasal breathing has positive effects on the limbic system  the parts of the brain that regulate emotion and behaviour  in ways that mouth breathing doesnt. A 2023 study, for example, found that nose breathing lowers blood pressure and the variability and frequency of the heart rate, indicating relaxation. Its not going to treat hypertension high blood pressure, says Joe Watso, an applied physiologist at Florida State University, who led the study. But breathing in and out through your nose seems to have a calming effect on your nervous system. Studies have even shown that breathing through your nose improves performance on spatial tasks, enhances memory function and betters your reaction time. Experts dont know exactly why that is. What we do know is breathing through your nose triggers the olfactory nerve  the nerves responsible for detecting odours  apparently even when theres nothing to smell. A leading theory is that this synchonises electrical activity across different areas of the brain including the amygdala and the hippocampus. Whatever the cause, nose breathing appears to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps the body to conserve energy and slows down bodily functions when youre relaxed. Science is telling us what meditators and yoga practitioners have said for thousands of years nose breathing can help with mental wellbeing. Some research indicates that rhythmic, drawn-out nasal breathing slows down brain waves across your entire cerebral cortex, indicating a calmer state of mind. Watso and others suggests nasal stimulation could even offer a physiological explanation for the benefits of meditating. Almost every part of my life has improved in the months since I got my nose fixed. That includes my mental health. My anxiety has lessened, Im more able to focus and my mood is better overall. It may be no coincidence. Callander says nose breathing could actually be making me a calmer guy. More like this  What earwax can reveal about your health  Do you need to use a phone case anymore?

"Title: Mexico sues Google over Gulf of America name change
Description: President Sheinbaum argues Trumps executive order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf.
Content: Mexico is suing Google for ignoring repeated requests not to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America for US users on its maps service, Claudia Sheinbaum has said. The Mexican president did not say where the lawsuit had been filed. Google did not respond to the BBCs request for comment. On Thursday, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to officially rename the Gulf for federal agencies. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office in January calling for the body of water to be renamed, arguing the change was justified because the US do most of the work there, and its ours. However, Sheinbaums government contends that Trumps order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf. All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with, she said, asserting that the US lacks the authority to rename the entire gulf. Sheinbaum wrote a letter to Google in January asking the firm to reconsider its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico for US users. The following month, she threatened legal action. At the time, Google said it made the change as part of a longstanding practice of following name changes when updated by official government sources. It said the gulf - which is bordered by the US, Cuba and Mexico - would not be changed for people using the app in Mexico, and users elsewhere in the world will see the label Gulf of Mexico Gulf of America. The Associated Press AP news agencys refusal to use the Gulf of America name led to a months-long conflict with the White House, which restricted APs access to certain events. A federal judge ordered the White House in April to stop sidelining the outlet. Trump hinted on Wednesday that he may recommend changing the way the US refers to another body of water. During an upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, he plans to announce that the US will henceforth refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, AP reported. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has responded by saying he hopes the absurd rumours are no more than a disinformation campaign and that such a move would bring the wrath of all Iranians.

"Title: US and UK agree deal slashing Trump tariffs on cars and metals
Description: It will leave a 10 import tax on most goods shipped from the UK to the US.
Content: The US has agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, as part of a new agreement between the US and UK. The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January. But it will leave a 10 duty in place on most goods from the UK. Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year. No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details. Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a fantastic platform. This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel, he said, adding that the the UK has no greater ally than the United States. At the White House, Trump called it a great deal and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance. This is a maxed out deal that were going to make bigger, he said. The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25 last month - to 10 for 100,000 cars a year. That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs. This was very serious, he said. It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough. Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Ministers Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously. The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative. The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20 duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes. Overall, the US said the deal would create a 5bn 3.8bn opportunity for exports, including 700m in ethanol and 250m in other agricultural products. It cant be understated how important this deal is, US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said. UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer major relief to the steel sector. The UK governments cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off, he said. Other business groups expressed more uncertainty. Its better than yesterday but its definitely not better than five weeks ago, said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade. Im trying to be excited but Im struggling a bit. While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US. This is not a historic deal with the US, she said. Weve been shafted. The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show complete disrespect to the public if MPs were denied a say. Sir Ed Davey said When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail. One thing is clear, Trumps trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK. Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a step in the right direction. He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development. The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move, he said. Its a Brexit benefit we were able to do this. The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trumps first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time. But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK. It was not clear how much those issues had advanced. The National Cattlemens Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a tremendous win for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes. The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports. While the UK appears to have made some commitments, the devil will be in the details, said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement. Other issues loom. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines. The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms preferential treatment. But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold  Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean. The UK ambassador to the US spoke to BBC Newsnight in his first broadcast interview since appointment. Hollywood blockbusters such and World War Z and Spider-Man, were made closer to home than you think. The government continues to push for a wider US trade pact after cutting car and steel tariffs.

"Title: Tariffs India battles Chinese dumping as Trumps trade tensions escalate
Description: Experts warn that a flood of cheap Chinese goods could hurt the competitiveness of Indian exports.
Content: The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsus spinning mill in southern Indias Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down. The viscose yarn  a popular material that goes into making woven garments  he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40 in the last month. Thats because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees 0.18 0.13 per kilo and flooded Indian ports. With Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145 on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets. Indias textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs. While China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps. Mill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn wont survive the onslaught of such competition. We cant match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap, he says. Jagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are slowing production. Many say theyll be forced to scale down further if the issue isnt addressed. Chinas Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers. We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries industries and economic development, he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper. But anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asias biggest economy - is the worlds largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals. While pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trumps 145 tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India. Their sudden inflow will prove very disruptive to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year. In 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization WTO shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India. India, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to 100bn 75bn. And imports in March jumped 25, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells. In response, Indias trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn. India also recently imposed a 12 tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down. Despite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modis government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020. Thats because the government has only had limited success with its plans to turn India into the worlds factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products. While western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit. Indias burgeoning deficit is a worrying story, says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative GTRI think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters. This isnt just a trade imbalance. Its a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI production linked incentive schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth, Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more. We cant bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap. India needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura. Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being swamped by China, he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view. With fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US. China wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny. Despite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.

"Title: Bank of England boss UK must do everything to rebuild trade with EU
Description: Andrew Bailey says he does not take a view on Brexit, but reversing the post-Brexit hit to UK-EU trade would be beneficial.
Content: The governor of the Bank of England has said the UK now needs to rebuild its trade relationship with the European Union and do everything we can to improve long-term trade, after Thursdays US deal. Andrew Bailey told the BBC that as a public official he did not take a view on Brexit, but that reversing the post-Brexit hit to UK-EU trade would be beneficial. The government is currently in talks with the EU on its plan to reset its trade and security relationship ahead of a summit later this month. The US deal has left space for the UK to pursue a veterinary agreement with the EU, including alignment on standards in order to lower post-Brexit red tape on food, farm and fish exports. As part of a new agreement between the US and the UK, the White House agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free. But it will leave a 10 duty in place on most goods from the UK. Pushed on what impact a closer relationship between the UK and the EU would have on the economy and inflation, Mr Bailey said It would be beneficial - having a more open economy to trade with the European Union. Because there has been a fall-off in goods trade with the EU over recent years. He added that it mattered because the EU is the UKs largest trading partner. It is important we do everything we can to ensure that whatever decisions are taken on the Brexit front do not damage the long-term trade position. So I hope that we can use this to start to rebuild that relationship, Mr Bailey said. The governor also said that the UKs deal-making across the world was setting an important example to other countries. It demonstrates that trade deals are important. Trade deals can be done, and the trade is important. Honestly, it seems an unpromising landscape at times. But I hope that we can use these deals to rebuild the world trading system, he said.

"Title: Zara Inside the secretive world of the fashion brand
Description: The BBCs Emma Simpson gets a rare glimpse behind the scenes of how the fashion brand operates.
Content: Its going to be a very sexy summer, a touch of romantic, cowboy and rock and roll. Thats according to Mehdi Sousanne, at least. And he should know. Hes a designer for Zara who helps create the clothes for a brand thats one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion. Zara is owned by Inditex, the worlds biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull  Bear. It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries. Zara doesnt advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, Ive come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates. Its a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs. But Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditexs CEO, says US President Donald Trumps tariffs wont disrupt its supply chains or change Zaras plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market. Bear in mind that for us, diversification is key. We are producing in almost 50 different markets with non-exclusive suppliers so we are more than used to adapt ourselves to change, he tells me. The business has certainly adapted and grown since its first store opened a short drive away in the town of A Coruna. It now has 350 designers, with the staff coming from some 40 different countries. There are no rules in general. Its all about feelings, says Mehdi, who works on delivering the key pieces for the season. He says inspiration can come from anyone ranging from the street to the cinema as well as the catwalks. He likes to sketch his ideas once an all-important mood board has been created. In the pattern cutting room, the designs are turned into paper samples, and are pinned on to mannequins. Dozens of seamstresses then run up the first fabric samples on the spot for a first fitting. Pattern maker Mar Marcote has been with the business 42 years and still uses a magnifying glass to examine each item of clothing before it finally goes into production. When you finish the item and see that it looks good, and then sometimes sells out, its marvellous, she says. Zara is a business that has changed the way we shop. In the old days, retailers released just two main collections a year, SpringSummer and AutumnWinter. For decades, most chains have outsourced manufacturing to lower-cost factories in the far east with the clothes arriving up to six months later. Zara went against conventional wisdom by sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently. That meant it could respond much faster to the latest trends and drop new items into stores every week. Just over half of its clothes are made in Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. Theres a factory doing small production runs on site at HQ, with another seven nearby, which it also owns. As a result, it can turn around products in a matter of weeks. More basic fashion staples are produced with longer lead times in countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh. Logistics and data are other factors behind its success. Every piece of clothing is packaged and despatched from its distribution centres in Spain, as well as one in the Netherlands. What is absolutely critical is the level of accuracy, says CEO Mr Maceiras. Its something that allows us to make the right decision in the last possible minute, in order to assess properly the appetite from our customers, in order to adapt our fashion proposition to the profile of our customers in different locations. In other words, getting the right products to the right shops. At HQ, product managers then receive real-time data on how clothes are selling in stores worldwide, and  crucially  feedback from customers, which is then shared with designers and buyers, who can adjust the ranges along the season according to demand. Unlike some other High Street rivals, it only discounts when it stages its twice-yearly sales. But is Zara starting to lose its shine after posting slower sales growth at the start of this year? The key challenge for Inditex is continuing to be relevant in a fashion world that continues to get faster and cheaper, says William Woods, European retail analyst for Bernstein. Not only are mainstream rivals like HM, Mango and Uniqlo trying to catch up, the market has been disrupted by Shein and Temu. Shein racked up 38bn in global sales last year, just a whisker behind Inditex. Asked how much of a threat Shein and Temus success poses to Zara, Mr Maceiras stresses that its business model doesnt rely on price. Of course, we are looking at providing our customers our products at an affordable price. But for us, its critical to provide customers fashion that should be inspirational, with quality, creativity and sustainable. Zara has come a long way since its founder Amancio Ortega started the business. The company is still majority-owned by his family and his daughter Marta is now chairwoman of the group. Now aged 89, Mr Ortega remains famously reclusive but still pops in, according to Mr Maceiras. Hes a presence, a physical or moral presence, absolutely every day. A cafe owner says he is already seeing more visitors coming into town. Bath Fashion Museum closed in 2022 with its collection stored in a glove factory in Wiltshire. The work in Abingdon Street and Fish Street will be complete by the end of the month, council says. The owners say Atria Watford will revert to the old Harlequin name as a result of public feedback.

"Title: Trump proposes 80 China tariff ahead of trade talks
Description: The meeting is the strongest sign yet that the worlds two biggest economies are ready to de-escalate their trade war.
Content: US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting tariffs on goods from China, in his latest comment to signal interest in de-escalating the trade war between the worlds two biggest economies. 80 Tariff on China seems right, Trump wrote on social media on Friday, ahead of trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland. Chinas Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also struck a confident note ahead of the meetings, saying Beijing had full confidence in its ability to manage trade issues with the US. Since returning to the White House, Trump has hit Chinese imports with 145 tariffs and China has retaliated with levies of 125 on some US goods, driving down trade between the two nations. On Friday, official figures for April showed Chinas exports to the US fell by more than 20 compared to a year earlier. But at the same time its total exports rose by a better-than-expected 8.1. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are under growing economic pressure, Dan Wang from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group told the BBC. The recent signals from both sides suggest a transactional de-escalation is on the table, she added. The announcement earlier this week of the talks was welcomed as an important first step towards easing tensions but analysts have warned that this marks the start of what are likely to be lengthy negotiations. The systemic frictions between the US and China will not be resolved any time soon, said former US trade negotiator, Stephen Olson. Any cuts to tariffs as a result of this meeting are likely to be minor, he added. The initial negotiations will be led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinas Vice Premier and economic tsar He Lifeng. But I think everyone recognises that any final deal will require the active engagement of both presidents, Mr Olson said. Another trade expert said that even if the new tariffs imposed by Trump were lifted, the two countries would still have major issues to overcome. A realistic goal is probably at best a pullback from the sky-high bilateral tariffs but that would still leave in place high tariff barriers and various other restrictions, the former head of the International Monetary Funds IMF China division, Eswar Prasad told BBC News. On social media on Friday, Trump called on China to open up its market to the US. He said any tariff reduction would be up to Scott B. In earlier remarks on Thursday, he had said he expected a very friendly meeting. The talks between China and the US are set to take place just two days after the UK became the first country to strike a tariffs deal with the Trump administration. The US agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, in exchange for new access to US beef and other exports, according to an outline of the new agreement. Countries around the world are scrambling to make similar deals before steep US import taxes are due to take effect next month. Trump announced what he called reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries in April but paused them shortly afterwards for 90 days to give their governments time to negotiate with his administration. Businesses based in the US will also be watching events in Switzerland closely. Wild Rye, a womens outdoor clothing firm based in the state of Idaho, has manufacturing stations in China and has been severely affected by the tariffs. The cost of shipping goods has jumped significantly, the firms chief executive, Cassie Abel, told the BBCs Today programme. We have a purchase order thats incoming, which is around 700,000 of goods thats now costing 1.2m in levies up from 200,000, she said. Ms Abel added she was now looking to sell parts of her business to try to raise cash.

"Title: Mexico sues Google over Gulf of America name change
Description: President Sheinbaum argues Trumps executive order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf.
Content: Mexico is suing Google for ignoring repeated requests not to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America for US users on its maps service, Claudia Sheinbaum has said. The Mexican president did not say where the lawsuit had been filed. Google did not respond to the BBCs request for comment. On Thursday, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to officially rename the Gulf for federal agencies. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office in January calling for the body of water to be renamed, arguing the change was justified because the US do most of the work there, and its ours. However, Sheinbaums government contends that Trumps order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf. All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with, she said, asserting that the US lacks the authority to rename the entire gulf. Sheinbaum wrote a letter to Google in January asking the firm to reconsider its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico for US users. The following month, she threatened legal action. At the time, Google said it made the change as part of a longstanding practice of following name changes when updated by official government sources. It said the gulf - which is bordered by the US, Cuba and Mexico - would not be changed for people using the app in Mexico, and users elsewhere in the world will see the label Gulf of Mexico Gulf of America. The Associated Press AP news agencys refusal to use the Gulf of America name led to a months-long conflict with the White House, which restricted APs access to certain events. A federal judge ordered the White House in April to stop sidelining the outlet. Trump hinted on Wednesday that he may recommend changing the way the US refers to another body of water. During an upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, he plans to announce that the US will henceforth refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, AP reported.

"Title: Queensland government held 21-minute consultation on puberty blocker ban at same time it announced decision
Description: Exclusive Legal challenge launched as expert says an alleged failure to conduct genuine consultations could lead to ban being overturned
Content: Exclusive Legal challenge launched as expert says an alleged failure to conduct genuine consultations could lead to ban being overturned The legality of Queenslands ban on puberty blockers has been questioned after it was revealed the state government undertook 21 minutes of internal consultation at the same time as a press conference announcing the decision. According to one administrative law expert, an alleged failure to conduct genuine consultation could lead to it being overturned in a legal challenge launched this week. Under section 48 of the Hospital and Health Boards Act 2011, the director general of Queensland Health must consult with a service in developing a health service directive that applies to it. According to a response by the health minister, Tim Nicholls, to a parliamentary question on notice, that consultation took place from about 10am on 28 January, finishing at 10.21am. The minister announced the governments decision to implement the directive at a press conference that started at 10.06am. Nicholls announced an immediate pause on new public patients receiving hormone therapy. The government has made these four decisions that Im announcing today including the directive, he said, about 11 minutes into the 24-minute press conference. Sign up for Guardian Australias breaking news email The directive bans public facilities from prescribing stage one or stage two hormone therapies. It applies only to transgender children puberty blockers can still be prescribed for precocious puberty and other conditions. Prof Anthony Cassimatis, the deputy director of the centre for public, international and comparative law at the University of Queensland, said similar decisions had been quashed in the past for lack of genuine consultation because the time involved was so short. He pointed to the case of Carrascalao v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. In that case, the decision maker cancelled a visa after about four hours consideration. The federal court didnt like that, Cassimatis said. They thought that that cant have been genuine consideration to have happened so quickly. The circumstances relating to the health directive would appear to be even more dramatic than that, he said. Parliament has required the decision maker to consider the advice provided during the consultation and that needs to be consideration in some meaningful sense, Cassimatis said. The health minister revealed the consultation timeline on 1 May, in a response to a parliamentary question on notice by Greens MP Michael Berkman. Prior to issuing the directive, the chief executive formally consulted with all hospital and health service chief executives, Nicholls said in his response. A meeting was scheduled from 1000am on Tuesday 28 January 2025 and I am advised that it concluded at 1021am. The health service directive was shared, read through in detail and discussed collectively at the meeting. Sign up to Morning Mail Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you whats happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion According to documents obtained by Guardian Australia under right to information laws, the minister was sent a version of a press release announcing the decision the previous day, Monday 27 January, at 4.34pm. Berkman said the government had clearly made its decision before the 21-minute consultation was finished. A legal challenge against the decision by the mother of a transgender child was launched this week by the LGBTI Legal Service. Matilda Alexander, a spokesperson for the service, said the timing of the consultation meeting would become part of its lawsuit. A spokesperson for Nicholls said As the matter is the subject of a legal action currently in the supreme court, it is inappropriate to comment further. The director general of health was also asked for comment, and responded As the matter is the subject of a legal action currently in the supreme court, it is inappropriate to comment further. According to his statement of reasons filed in the case, the Queensland health director general, David Rosengren, made two minor refinements to the directive as a result of the consultation. The directive was issued at 11.07am on January 28 and published online. The ban on puberty blockers will remain in effect until the completion of a study by psychiatrist Dr Ruth Vine. It is due to be completed by 30 November.",0
"Title: Trump administration invokes state secrets privilege in Kilmar Ábrego García case
Description: Lawyers say theyre still in dark about governments efforts to free the man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador
Content: Lawyers say theyre still in dark about governments efforts to free the man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador The Trump administration is invoking the state secrets privilege  in an apparent attempt to avoid answering a judges questions about its erroneous deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García to El Salvador. US district judge Paula Xinis disclosed the governments position in a two-page order on Wednesday. She set a Monday deadline for attorneys to file briefs on the issue and how it could affect Ábrego Garcías case. Xinis also scheduled a 16 May hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland, to address the matter. The Republican administration previously invoked the same legal authority to cut off a judges inquiry into whether it defied an order to turn around planes deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. Ábrego García, 29, has been imprisoned in his native El Salvador for nearly two months. His mistaken deportation has become a flash point for Donald Trumps immigration policies and his increasing friction with the US courts. Trump has said he could call El Salvadors president and have Ábrego García, who was living in Maryland, returned to the United States. Instead, Trump has doubled down on his claims that Ábrego García is a member of the MS-13 gang. Police in Maryland had identified Ábrego García as an MS-13 gang member in 2019 based off his tattoos, Chicago Bulls hoodie and the word of a criminal informant. But Ábrego García was never charged. His lawyers say the informant claimed Ábrego García was in an MS-13 chapter in New York, where Ábrego García has never lived. The administration has balked at telling Xinis what, if anything, it has done to facilitate Ábrego Garcías return to the US. The judge ruled that his lawyers can question several Trump administration officials under oath about the governments response to her orders. In a court filing on Wednesday, his lawyers said they already have conducted depositions of three officials and are still in the dark about the governments efforts to free Ábrego García. They are asking for permission to depose more officials, possibly including one from the White House.",0
"Title: NSW woman faces court after being charged with murder of two grandsons
Description: The 66-year-old appeared at Parramatta court on Saturday after being charged with murdering her grandsons aged six and seven
Content: The 66-year-old appeared at Parramatta court on Saturday after being charged with murdering her grandsons aged six and seven Two young boys might have been murdered hours before officers were called to their semi-rural home and found their bodies in separate bedrooms, police allege. Details of the boys deaths, which have shocked the small community of Coonabarabran in north-west NSW, were revealed as their grandmother and accused killer appeared in court for the first time. Kathleen Heggs, 66, will be held in custody for at least another 10 days after making no application for bail during a brief appearance at Parramatta Bail court on Saturday. She was charged the previous day after spending several days in hospital since the bodies of brothers Max and Sam, aged seven and six, were found in separate bedrooms inside their home just after 2pm on Monday. Two junior police officers went to the property, which is located about 10km from the centre of the farming town, after a message sent to the communities and justice department triggered an emergency response. They broke into the home to find the boys bodies, while their maternal grandmother was nearby after allegedly trying to harm herself. Heggs allegedly killed the boys as early as 10.30am that day, court documents said. She appeared briefly on a video link during the initial appearance, when she said she understood the charges she was facing.

Content: Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, after MoD said he had departed for private reasons The head of the Royal Navy has been suspended pending an investigation. Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, sources at the MoD confirmed on Friday. Key was absent from the lineup of senior military personnel on the Mall on Monday for celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, and it is understood that second sea lord V Adm Martin Connell has taken full charge until a permanent replacement is announced. Earlier this week the MoD said Key had departed for private reasons. Key joined the Royal Navy in 1984 as a university cadet, and graduated from Royal Holloway, University of London. As a junior officer he saw service around the world, after qualifying as helicopter aircrew and a principal warfare officer. He was made vice admiral in February 2016, before becoming the Royal Navys fleet commander and later chief of joint operations until he was appointed first sea lord in 2021. Over his career, he has commanded four ships the mine hunter HMS Sandown, the frigates HMS Iron Duke and HMS Lancaster, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. An Iraq war veteran, prior to taking over the Navy Key was also awarded a US bronze star and oversaw the retreat from Afghanistan. In his current role, he is also chief of the naval staff and chair of the navy board, where he is responsible to the secretary of state for the fighting effectiveness, efficiency and morale of the service. Key last year issued an unreserved apology for intolerable misogyny in the Submarine Service, after a series of investigations across the navy exposed sexual harassment, bullying and assault of women within its ranks. The navy chief said he was truly sorry to the women who had suffered misogyny, bullying and other unacceptable behaviours while serving their country. We must be better than this and do better than we have, he said. The MoD said on Friday An investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.",0
"Title: Whiplash reversals mean Trumps erratic trade policy is as clear as mud
Description: The specifics of the administrations economic masterplan  from strollers to movies to China  change by the day
Content: The specifics of the administrations economic masterplan  from strollers to movies to China  change by the day Decades of economic orthodoxy failed millions of Americans, according to Donald Trump, who marched back into the White House promising to shred the status quo. But the specifics of his alternative  exactly how his administration claims it will make America great again  change by the day. The US president declared this week to be a key milestone of his second term, as he unveiled his first major trade deal since returning to office following accelerated talks with the UK. But it came as Trumps position, on everything from tariffs on strollers and movies to whether his administration even wants to strike such global deals, appeared to shift by the hour. Firms across the world have been trying to come to terms with the rapid rate of presidential kneejerks where policies can be announced, adjusted and shelved as quickly as the leader of the free world can publish a social media post. Theres so much uncertainty, Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair and persona non grata in Trumpworld, observed on Wednesday. If you talk to businesses, or market participants, or forecasters, everyone is just waiting to see how developments play out. Take strollers. This was the week when Trump argued that some prices are more important than others. After pledging to bring down prices, the president was keen to focus on those that had fallen during an NBC News interview that aired last weekend. His interviewer, however, observed that some had risen with an estimated 97 of strollers bought in the US made in China, for example, prices have risen significantly since Trump hiked tariffs dramatically on the country. The president was having none of it. The declining price of fuel is thousands of times more important than a stroller, he asserted. Later in the interview, he demanded more positive questions. Because you know what? Gasolines big business, he said. A stroller is not big business. On Sunday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Sure, strollers might be more expensive  but thats peanuts in the grand scheme of things. Other costs are thousands of times more important. By Wednesday, the administration was moving in a different direction. Potential tariff exemptions for childcare and baby products  like car seats, cribs and, yes, strollers  were under consideration, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told Congress. Then there was movies. This was also the week when Trump emphatically stood up for Hollywood. The president abruptly announced his concern that Hollywood was DYING a very fast death over the weekend. A 100 tariff would be imposed upon any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands, he wrote on Truth Social. Many US blockbusters are produced, shot and edited in a variety of countries. There was no detail as to how the policy would be executed. It was unclear which films would and would not face tariffs. Sign up to Trump on Trial Stay up to date on all of Donald Trumps trials. Guardian staff will send news and updates directly to your inbox. after newsletter promotion But on Sunday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Hollywood had been devastated by the rise of movie production elsewhere this amounted to a national security threat and US officials would immediately start work on steep tariffs. By Monday, the administration was moving in a different direction. The White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that no final decisions had been made, and the administration was exploring all options. And take deals. This was also the week when Trump, author of Trump The Art of the Deal, announced he was done with them. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised to negotiate agreements that would end wars and tilt the world economy in his countrys favor. But earlier this week, surrounded by cameras in the Oval Office, the president complained the media had become fixated. You keep writing about deals, deals, he told reporters. I wish theyd stop asking how many deals are you signing this week? because one day, well come and well give you a hundred deals. And they dont have to sign. And I think my people havent made it clear, said the president. While the US will sign some deals, tariffs were a much bigger focus. Overseas companies are going to have to pay to shop in the US, he added. Think of us as a super luxury store. On Tuesday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Trade deals were not the be-all and end-all. The US will make demands of trading partners, and unless they agree, it will continue to hit them with sweeping tariffs. By Thursday, the administration was moving in a different direction. Unveiling a maxed-out deal that were going to make bigger, Trump declared that a trade accord with the UK would be just the first. In reality, the UK-US deal was unfinished. The announcement felt hasty the diplomatic equivalent of hosting a wedding reception after the engagement, but before the ceremony. Both Trump and Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, conceded certain details had yet to be finalized. But the president was off  many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good GREAT! ones, he wrote on Truth Social the following day  which brings us to China. No economy has been targeted more aggressively, or hit harder, by this administration. Trump has insisted any pain, be it higher prices or empty shelves, would be worth bearing as Washington pushed back hard against Beijing. IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID, he wrote of his tariff strategy in February. Trump sparked a trade war between the worlds two largest economies by ramping up US tariffs on Chinese goods to 145, prompting swift retaliation. They deserve it, he told ABC News last week. They were ripping us off like nobodys ever ripped us off. But today, the administration appears to be moving in a different direction. Bessent has been dispatched to Geneva to negotiate with Chinese officials. The president, who has for months maintained that the US must hold the line against China, stressed the treasury secretary was leading these talks  but threw in his two cents. 80 Tariff on China seems right, he wrote on Truth Social, proposing a drastic reduction. Up to Scott B. What happens next is anyones guess. But its safe to say it probably wont be up to Scott B.",0

Content: Move sparks outrage in Iran as diplomats try to broker deal between Tehran and Washington over nuclear programme Donald Trump plans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the US will now refer to the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia rather than the Persian Gulf. The move has prompted outrage from Iranian leaders, and last-minute efforts are being made to persuade Trump to pull back from offending Iran in the midst of vital talks on the future of the Iranian nuclear programme. If Trump went ahead with the proposal he would manage to unite every Iranian, pro- or anti-regime, against him, and that is a near impossible achievement, one diplomat said. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he hoped the absurd rumour about a name change was disinformation, adding that names of Middle East waterways did not imply ownership by any particular nation, but rather reflects a shared respect for the collective heritage of humanity. The name Persian Gulf, like many geographical designations, is deeply rooted in human history. Iran has never objected to the use of names such as the Sea of Oman, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea or Red Sea. In contrast, politically motivated attempts to alter the historically established name of the Persian Gulf are indicative of hostile intent toward Iran and its people, and are firmly condemned. Such biased actions are an affront to all Iranians, regardless of their background or place of residence. Any shortsighted step in this connection will have no validity or legal or geographical effect, it will only bring the wrath of all Iranians from all walks of life and political persuasion in Iran, the US and across the world. Arab nations have pushed for a change to the geographic name of the body of water off the southern coast of Iran, while Iran has maintained its historic ties to the Gulf. The term Persian Gulf has been used since Roman times and the Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, with Iranians tracing their history back to the Persian empire. The use of Gulf of Arabia and Arabian Gulf is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran  formerly Persia  threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the companys decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps. But Trump regards the US decision to change how the US administration describes the Gulf as a gift to Arab leaders that will lead them to offer concessions regarding their relations with Israel. The move comes several months after Trump said the US would refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. European diplomats trying to broker a deal between the US and Iran over the nuclear programme are urging the Iranian leadership not to lose it over Trumps actions, but there are fears that hardliners in Iran opposed to the principle of talks with the US will use Trumps gesture as a lever with which to argue the US cannot be trusted. But JD Vance, the vice-president, speaking at a Munich Security Conference event in Washington, gave a very upbeat account of the talks, saying So far so good ... Our proposition is simple we dont care if people want nuclear power. They can have civil nuclear power. We dont mind that. But you cant have the kind of enrichment programme that allows you to get to a nuclear weapon and thats where we draw the line. Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion He said the two sides might be on the verge of a deal that reintegrates Iran into the global economy. His reference to a kind of enrichment programme suggests the Americans may be prepared to allow Iranians to enrich uranium to some degree under the supervision of the UNs nuclear inspectors, the IAEA. There has been controversy in the past about how US officials refer to the Gulf.",0
"Title: Are we heading for another world war  or has it already started?
Description: The rules-based world order is in retreat and violence is on the rise, forcing countries to rethink their relationships
Content: The rules-based world order is in retreat and violence is on the rise, forcing countries to rethink their relationships In a week in which former allies in a redividing globe separately commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, the sense of a runaway descent towards a third world war draws ever closer. The implosion of Pax Americana, the interconnectedness of conflicts, the new willingness to resort to unbridled state-sponsored violence and the irrelevance of the institutions of the rules-based order have all been on brutal display this week. From Kashmir to Khan Younis, Hodeidah, Port Sudan and Kursk, the only sound is of explosions, and the only lesson is that the old rules no longer apply. Indeed Fiona Hill, the policy analyst and adviser to the UK government on its imminent strategic defence review, argues the third world war has already started, if only we would recognise it. The fear of a world in which no one, due to science or globalisation, is any longer in control is hardly new the concept was the title of two Reith lectures, one in 1967 by the social anthropologist Edmund Leach and another in 1999 by the political philosopher Anthony Giddens. But rarely has been it so clear that the rules-based world order created in 1945 is in headlong retreat. The former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband put it well this week at Chatham House, saying I know that people always say the world is changing, but this feels like a moment of genuine geopolitical flux, at least as significant as 1989-90 when the world transitioned from the cold war to a unipolar moment, and for me the Trump administration is both symptom and cause of the changes under way. The problem is that its much more clear what we are inflecting from  a world in which the US was the anchor of the global system  but its not clear what were inflecting to. I know theres a lot of talk about the idea of a multipolar world reflecting a redistribution of the balance of power, but I find that concept conveying too much stability, too much security. His one-time mentor Tony Blair, in a talk in California, argued Everyone has been shaken out of their comfort zone. The noise you are hearing from the political undergrowth is the frantic foraging for options. People are rethinking their position in the world and their relationships. There is no doubt at all this is a major shock. This is the most significant geostrategic event I can remember in terms of America and the world. For the former US secretary of state Antony Blinken, Donald Trumps indifference to alienating allies is an act of vandalism. He said diplomats around the world were asking What the fuck is going on? Blinken said America had spent 80 years building up trust, strong economic partnerships and military and political alliances, and if that was then taken down in a matter of 100 days it would be incredibly hard to rebuild. It means countries look for ways to work around us, to work together but without the US, he said. The possibility that what will be said today will be reversed tomorrow, and will be reversed again, means they simply cannot count on us. Joe Biden used to say it is never a good idea to bet against America. The problem we now have is people are no longer betting on America. The doleful consequences of Americas withdrawal have been visible all week. It may or may not be a world war but it is a world at war. In Gaza the world has watched as a blockade on food, aid and medical supplies, in defiance of binding orders by the international court of justice ICJ, has now entered into its third month. Israel, in search of security, has in the past month bombed Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. It is daily urging the US to be given permission to bomb Iran. Trump can hardly complain when Bezalel Smotrich, Israels ultra-right finance minister, shared his vision for the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, predicting that within half a year the population of the territory would be confined to just a narrow swathe of land, with the remainder totally destroyed. Smotrich was only repeating a version of Trumps plan to empty Gaza of Palestinians, a plan totally at odds with the ceasefire terms his envoy had negotiated. In remarks at a settlements conference, Smotrich also declared that Israel would apply sovereignty in the West Bank within the lifetime of the current government, which is due to expire in October 2026 unless elections are called earlier. Within a few months, we will be able to declare that we have won. Gaza will be totally destroyed, Smotrich said. In another six months, Hamas wont exist as a functioning entity. With Trump silent, it was left to Europe to respond. It is time for the European Union and the entire international community to wake up, said the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot. He denounced the blockade as an absolute disgrace  It is not acceptable deliberately cutting off all humanitarian aid, all access to food, healthcare, electricity and water, as a war strategy, is totally unacceptable. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said If we condemn Russia for violating Ukrainian sovereignty, we cannot remain silent when it happens in Gaza. Hamas must be fought, yes, but not at the cost of trampling on all the rules. He called for a united response by Europe, yet at a foreign affairs meeting in Poland the 27 ministers could not even agree on a joint statement, let alone joint action to suspend its free trade agreement with Israel, a Dutch proposal. Meanwhile in Port Sudan, the conduit for humanitarian aid into Sudan, Rapid Support Forces drones destroyed infrastructure, just as Israeli bombs have sought to do this week in Hodeidah, the chief entry point for aid into Yemen. On Monday an effort by the Sudanese government to hold the United Arab Emirates accountable at the ICJ for directing arms to the RSF ended in failure. The UAE, like many other nations, is a signatory to the genocide convention, but it has entered a reservation insisting its compliance with the convention is not subject to ICJ proceedings. The ICJ meekly concluded there was a manifest lack of jurisdiction. Only one judge, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf from Somali, objected. So the UAE gains kudos of signing the convention without needing to be judged on meeting its obligations. It has been left to the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to make a valiant effort to coax the parties to a ceasefire, but so far it has foundered. The US, by contrast, labels RSF leaders as genocidal but does nothing in practical diplomatic terms. In Kashmir, where two nuclear-armed states are firing rockets at one anothers aircraft, there is a conspicuous absence of American interest. The US has no ambassador in India or Pakistan and no senior state department official appointed. The conflict is not making waves in US media, and Trumps initial response was its a shame and that if you think about it they have been fighting for many, many decades, and centuries, actually. In previous disputes between India and Pakistan it took a decisive US intervention to help calm both sides. In July 1999 in Washington, Bill Clinton personally browbeat Pakistans then leader, Nawaz Sharif, into retreat in what one official called the most important meeting with a foreign leader of Clintons presidency. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo revealed in his memoir how close the two sides came in February 2019 to a nuclear conflagration, something he frantically helped stop from a secure hotel room on a visit to Hanoi. Unnervingly, India is no longer framing the issue as terrorism but as a state-on-state dispute by saying the underlying issue is Pakistan acting as a shield for terrorism. These conflicts may be disconnected save the common thread of absent US leadership and permanent upheaval. But in Ukraine the structural elements of the world war come together, Hill argues. The scale of the death toll may be different to the second world war, but according to the UK military this week Russia has suffered 900,000 casualties, far in excess of its losses during previous wars in Chechyna and Afghanistan. Moreover, the wars are now, in her words, system-changing conflicts with multivector loads of countries involved. Chinese-flagged trawlers with Russians onboard rupturing undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is only one part of Vladimir Putins global war. China, North Korea and Iran are all supporting Russia, some in more material ways such as building drone factories or supplying soldiers. A host of other countries have been happy to keep Russia economically afloat in ways that make their neutrality contestable. India, with which the UK has completed a free trade deal this week, has bought 112bn of oil from Russia since the war started, and also bought Russian arms. The conflict has been presented by Russia and its allies as a war about American hegemony. Trump clearly had a plan to extricate the US from the line of fire and to put relations with Russia on a different footing, a desire he has nursed since the 1980s. Trump sees the world in similar terms to Putin  a handful of sovereign powers dividing up land into spheres of influence. His dream is to re-enact Yalta 1945 alongside Putin and possibly Xi Jinping, with Europe an onlooker and Ukraine dismembered. But organising a decent betrayal has proved more difficult than expected. In the White House, Trump famously told Volodymyr Zelenskyy You have to be thankful. You dont have the cards. But Trump overplayed the cards he had, throwing many of them away with his self-destructive tariff war. And it emerged that Zelenskyy did in fact have a few cards left, deploying them skilfully by offering a 30-day ceasefire, a minerals deal with the US, and focusing on Ukraines military value to western security. The intimate photo of Trump and Zelenskyy in conclave at the funeral of the pope a picture taken by Zelenskyys chief of staff, Andriy Yermak reeked of reconciliation yet flattered Trumps ego. A change in mood in Washington is now discernible. Even JD Vance, the vice-president, once agitator-in-chief against Zelenskyy, this week admitted Russia was asking for too much and said Europe and the US were on the same team. Europes leaders would dearly welcome that, but there is now a clarity across Europe, and not just in Paris, that regardless of Vances reassurance, Europe has to have the capability to operate autonomously of the US. Trump is self-evidently not reliable, and his benign assessment of Putins intentions is not shared. Planning for a European reassurance force in Ukraine is under way, as is planning for a potential Russian attack on Europe. Since February, France and the UK, through a combined joint expeditionary force, have formed the nucleus of that planning, but this has broadened, with new political leadership increasingly coming from four members of the Weimar group Poland, France, Germany and the UK. In a speech marking VE Day, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, explained the double necessity for Europe to be prepared for war. Russias war of aggression had shattered the European security order, with the imperial delusion that the war in Ukraine could be conflated with the great patriotic war. Then he added The fact that now even the United States, who did so much to create and shape this order, is turning its back on it is a shock on an entirely new scale. That is why I speak of a double epochal shift  Russias war of aggression and the US break with its values  that is what marks the end of this long 20th century. Europe, he insisted, must decide what comes next.",0
"Title: European and British soils seriously degraded by intensive farming
Description: Experts found 60 of the EUs agricultural soils had been degraded, with about 40 similarly damaged in the UK
Content: Experts found 60 of the EUs agricultural soils had been degraded, with about 40 similarly damaged in the UK More than 60 of the EUs agricultural soils are degraded due to intensive agriculture, with similar damage to about 40 of British soils, a report has found. Experts from the Save Soil initiative said nourishing and restoring agricultural soils could reduce the impact of the climate crisis and provide protection against the worsening extremes of weather, as well as the food shortages and price rises likely to accompany them. This degradation of soil is changing the lands water cycle and exacerbating the impact of the climate crisis in a vicious circle. Impoverished soils, lacking their natural structure, are incapable of holding water in any quantity, so that when it rains, the water tends to run off them, worsening flooding but in times of drought, when healthy soils would act as a sponge, poor soils have little resilience. Save Soil, which advocates regenerative farming practices, called for soil restoration to be made a key priority of climate programmes, and for changes in agricultural policies and subsidies to reward it. Europe and the UK are experiencing extremes  parched fields one month, flooded towns the next. What this report makes clear is that our soils are no longer buffering us, said a spokesperson for the group. We are losing the natural infrastructure that manages water. In 2022, a third of the EU population and 40 of the blocs land were affected by water scarcity, while Spain, Italy and Germany have also seen disastrous floods in 2023-2024, the report noted. Groundwater levels have dropped by a third in France, and the UK is likely to see drought this year despite record rain last year. Nearly half of the global urban population, about 2.4 billion people, will face water scarcity by 2050, according to the UN. Price rises of some commodities affected by the climate crisis, including coffee and chocolate, are already being seen by consumers. Last year, a UN study found an excess of salt was already reducing the fertility of at least 10 of land globally, while a further 1bn hectares were under threat. Healthy soils also store more carbon, helping to offset the impact of fossil fuels. Sign up to Down to Earth The planets most important stories. Get all the weeks environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Karen Johnson, professor of environmental engineering at Durham University, who was not involved with the report, said Soil is a living material intimately connected to human and planetary health and it is only by working with soil as a living material that we can address the global challenges facing water. Lets work with the soil microbiome instead of against it  we may as well harness over three billion years of evolutionary knowledge. Hannah Blitzer, a senior policy officer at the Soil Association, called on the UK government to take action It is essential that soil is better protected  the UK government should give this vital resource the same protection as water and air, while also backing nature-friendly farming like organic that puts soil health first. This means moving away from reliance on harmful artificial pesticides and fertilisers and switching to building resilience in soils through nature-based solutions. In the UK, farmers can be paid to protect and restore their soils through government schemes. However, one of the key programmes, the sustainable farming incentive, has been paused, and funding for nature-friendly farming is under threat as the Treasury reviews expenditure, leaving farmers in doubt over whether to invest in changing their practices. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said This government recognises the importance of healthy, functioning soil for resilience against the impacts of climate change, such as flooding and drought and to protect food security. That is why we are taking action through agri-environment schemes to encourage land management practices that focus on a sustainable approach to farm and soil management.",0
"Title: Head of Royal Navy suspended pending investigation
Description: Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, after MoD said he had departed for private reasons
Content: Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, after MoD said he had departed for private reasons The head of the Royal Navy has been suspended pending an investigation. Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, sources at the MoD confirmed on Friday. Key was absent from the lineup of senior military personnel on the Mall on Monday for celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, and it is understood that second sea lord V Adm Martin Connell has taken full charge until a permanent replacement is announced. Earlier this week the MoD said Key had departed for private reasons. Key joined the Royal Navy in 1984 as a university cadet, and graduated from Royal Holloway, University of London. As a junior officer he saw service around the world, after qualifying as helicopter aircrew and a principal warfare officer. He was made vice admiral in February 2016, before becoming the Royal Navys fleet commander and later chief of joint operations until he was appointed first sea lord in 2021. Over his career, he has commanded four ships the mine hunter HMS Sandown, the frigates HMS Iron Duke and HMS Lancaster, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. An Iraq war veteran, prior to taking over the Navy Key was also awarded a US bronze star and oversaw the retreat from Afghanistan. In his current role, he is also chief of the naval staff and chair of the navy board, where he is responsible to the secretary of state for the fighting effectiveness, efficiency and morale of the service. Key last year issued an unreserved apology for intolerable misogyny in the Submarine Service, after a series of investigations across the navy exposed sexual harassment, bullying and assault of women within its ranks. The navy chief said he was truly sorry to the women who had suffered misogyny, bullying and other unacceptable behaviours while serving their country. We must be better than this and do better than we have, he said. The MoD said on Friday An investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.",0
"Title: Pixel 9 Pro review a real contender for the best small phone

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more. The Pixel 9 Pro is a rare beast a smaller phone that keeps the same bold design, specs and camera as Googles biggest and most expensive model. It makes it an instant contender for the best small phone going. The Guardians journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more. At 999 1,099999A1,699, it is cheaper than its larger Pixel 9 Pro XL sibling but still firmly in the high-end bracket. What sets it apart is the 6.3in screen is significantly tighter than the monster 6.7in-plus sizes you usually need to get the very best hardware. While not exactly tiny, it is small for a modern high-end phone, joining only a handful in the market such as Samsungs 6.2in Galaxy S24 and the 6.1in iPhone 15 Pro. The screen is bright, fast and crisp, rivalling the best in the business. The bold new camera lump on the back makes the Pixel stand out, while the flat aluminium sides and frosted glass back look and feel expensive. The new Tensor G4 chip, 16GB of RAM and starting storage of 128GB all match the 9 Pro XL and perform similarly. It is snappy in operation and handles apps just fine, but cant match the raw performance of Android rivals running Qualcomms top chips, particularly in games. The Pixels battery life is pretty good for a smaller phone. It lasts just over 48 hours between charges with the screen actively used for about seven hours on a mix of 5G and wifi, meaning you have to charge it every other day or so. Thats a few hours short of its larger sibling, but a good 10 hours longer than the iPhone 15 Pro. A full charge takes just over 80 minutes using a 27W or greater USB-C charger not included. Screen 6.3in 120Hz QHD OLED 495ppi Processor Google Tensor G4 RAM 16GB of RAM Storage 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system Android 14 Camera 50MP  48MP ultrawide  48MP 5x telephoto, 42MP selfie Connectivity 5G, eSIM, wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3 and GNSS Water resistance IP68 1.5m for 30 minutes Dimensions 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm Weight 199g The Pixel ships with Android 14 and seven years of software support, including an upgrade to Android 15 in the autumn, making it one of the longest-lasting phones on the market. The big new additions for the Pixel phones this year are all AI-based, being some of the first handsets to run Googles latest Gemini Nano AI models on device. Similar to the 9 Pro XL, the new Gemini Live experience is undoubtedly the highlight. It provides a new, fully conversational mode allowing you to speak to Googles most advanced Gemini assistant with an open mic and have it respond via voice for a flowing, back and forth discussion. It is smart enough to remember the topics and progression of your conversation, can provide useful information and asks its own questions to help move things along. One chat I had with it, we discussed the fastest parkruns in the south-east of London. It asked if I was after a personal best, talked about the surfaces, discussed the average attendance each Saturday, then was able to give me travel times and the weather forecast for each park. The system is not perfect all the time, but the answers were very human, with a touch of personality. It requires a 19 a month Gemini Advanced subscription to use, a year of which is bundled free with any of the Pixel 9 Pro phones. Another useful AI utility is the Screenshots app, which collates your shots and makes them searchable. The Pixel Studio app quickly generates images via text prompts with a range of styles. The Google Photos Magic Editor can automatically reframe an image by either cropping or expanding the canvas using generative AI. The new reimagine feature goes one step further and can fully recast a photo or insert objects into it using text prompts. How far you go with it is up to you, but it can produce stunning images, or problematic ones, with very little effort. The camera is the 9 Pros crown jewel. It supports the full top Google camera system, including a 48MP ultrawide, 50MP main and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera, which comfortably outzooms similarly sized rivals that are typically limited to 3x. The cameras are all-round excellent, capturing detail-rich images across the board. They excel in more difficult scenes, such as dim lighting or motion. The 5x telephoto camera has an in-sensor zoom feature producing the equivalent of a 10x optical zoom to meaningfully close the distance to objects. The additional digital zoom, up to 30x, is surprisingly good in bright light too. The new Add Me feature helps photographers join group shots by blending two photos taken back to back into one image. The photographer takes the first shot then hands over camera duties to another member of the the group for the second shot. An augmented reality overlay shows where to position yourself to get in the shot. It works well in some scenarios, but requires practice to get right and sometimes trips up on certain objects in the scene. Google does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery, but it should maintain at least 80 of its original capacity after 500 full charge cycles. The phone is repairable by Google and third-party shops, with genuine replacement parts to be available from iFixit soon. The repair specialists awarded the Pixel 9 Pro XL five out of 10 for repairability. The Pixel 9 Pro is made with at least 18 recycled materials, including recycled aluminium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. The company breaks down the phones environmental impact in its report. Google will recycle old devices free of charge. The Google Pixel 9 Pro costs from 999 1,099999A1,699. For comparison, the Pixel 8a costs 499, the Pixel 9 costs 799, the Pixel 9 Pro XL costs 1,099, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costs 1,149 and the Apple iPhone 15 Pro costs 999. The Pixel 9 Pro is one of the very best small phones you can buy. The fabulous 6.3in screen may not be truly small, but the Pixel squeezes all the top-end hardware from Googles 6.8in superphone into a much smaller and more manageable body. That means you get the full camera system with a 5x optical zoom that rivals at this size simply cant match. You also get long battery life, decent performance, software support for seven years from release and all the latest cutting-edge AI features you can shake a stick at. A bundled years subscription to Gemini Advanced enables the impressive Gemini Live conversational AI assistant, too. It isnt a bargain at 999, but that sort of price is unfortunately par for the course for a high-end phone, matching Apples iPhone 15 Pro. Pros seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical zoom, great screen, good battery life, recycled aluminium, impressive local and generative AI features, Gemini Live included for a year. Cons expensive, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance short of best in class, temperature sensor is still a gimmick outside the US.",0
"Title: Meta blocks major Muslim Instagram page in India amid rising conflict
Description: Company referred to policy for restricting content when governments say material goes against local law
Content: Company referred to policy for restricting content when governments say material goes against local law Meta has banned a prominent Muslim news page on Instagram in India at the governments request, the accounts founder said on Wednesday, denouncing the move as censorship as hostilities escalate between India and Pakistan. Instagram users in India trying to access posts from the handle Muslim  a page with 6.7 million followers  were met with a message stating Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content. There was no immediate reaction from the Indian government on the ban, which comes after access was blocked to the social media accounts of Pakistani actors and cricketers. I received hundreds of messages, emails and comments from our followers in India, that they cannot access our account, Ameer Al-Khatahtbeh, the news accounts founder and editor-in-chief, said in a statement. Meta has blocked the Muslim account by legal request of the Indian government. This is censorship. Meta declined to comment. A spokesperson for the tech giant directed Agence France-Presse to a company webpage outlining its policy for restricting content when governments believe material on its platforms goes against local law. The development, first reported by the US tech journalist Taylor Lorenzs outlet User Magazine, comes in the wake of the worst violence between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan in two decades. Both countries have exchanged heavy artillery fire along their contested frontier, after New Delhi launched deadly missile strikes on its arch-rival. At least 43 deaths were reported in the fighting, which came two weeks after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing a deadly attack on tourists in the Indian-run side of the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. Pakistan rejects the charge and has warned it will avenge those killed by Indian airstrikes. The Muslim account is among the most followed Muslim news sources on Instagram. Khatahtbeh apologized to followers in India, adding When platforms and countries try to silence media, it tells us that we are doing our job in holding those in power accountable. We will continue to document the truth and stand out firmly for justice, he added, while calling on Meta to reinstate the account in India.

"Title: Can a methadone-dispensing robot free up nurses and improve patient care?
Description: A nurse and an engineer founded Opio Connect to make machines that dispense drugs and reduce drudge work
Content: A nurse and an engineer founded Opio Connect to make machines that dispense drugs and reduce drudge work Lanea George pulls open a steel security door and enters a windowless room where a video camera stares at what looks like a commercial-grade refrigerator. The machine, dubbed Bodhi, whirrs and spins before spitting out seven small plastic bottles containing precisely 70ml of methadone, a bright pink liquid resembling cherry cough syrup. It is used as a substitute for morphine or heroin in addiction treatment. She scoops the bottles off the tray, bundles them with a rubber band and sets them on a shelf. Its not yet 10am and George, the nurse manager at Man Alive, an opioid treatment program  known colloquially as a methadone clinic  in Baltimore, has already finished prepping the doses for the 100 or so patients who will arrive the next day. Bodhi has changed my life and the lives of our patients, she says. Thats because filling the prescriptions requires more than simply pouring medicine into a bottle. It means printing out and attaching the labels one by one, precisely measuring the amounts, sealing the bottles and screwing on the caps. A spill requires the nurse to stop the work, squeegee the lost liquid into a receptacle, measure it, record the incident and destroy the sample. Repeat that process 100 or more times, and its easy to see why, before Bodhi arrived, the task would have occupied a full day. The pressure to keep up causes many nurses to quit, as does the additional misery of carpal tunnel syndrome, which nurses often suffer from screwing on so many caps day after day, according to George. Ive seen nurses just leave during a shift and never come back, she says about previous clinics where she has worked. Now, instead of pouring doses, George spends more time interacting with patients. It lets me get more personal, have more in-depth conversations, she says. Thats where we get a lot of important information. More patient interaction was the idea when Amber Norbeck came up with the idea for the machine George now uses daily. A pharmacist in the natal intensive care unit at a Montana hospital, Norbeck said so many pregnant women there struggled with opioid dependencies that as many as 50 of the newborns suffered withdrawal symptoms. Methadone therapy helped the new mothers and moms-to-be, but access undermined their efforts some clinics she visited had 30- to 60-day waiting lists, while at others patients faced three-hour lines despite a flock of nurses toiling at service windows. Some methadone patients are required to return to clinics daily for their doses. It didnt look like healthcare, it looked like tellers in a bank pouring methadone, Norbeck says. For patients with kids and jobs and lives, getting the medication was so time-consuming that theyd just give up. As US overdose deaths from opioids rose from roughly 8,000 in 2009 to more than 114,000 in 2022, Norbeck saw a country caught between an opioid crisis and a nursing shortage. In 2019, she and Mike Pokorny, an engineer who had developed his own electric motor, began brainstorming ways to automate the assembly of methadone doses. They devised a robotic device that could pour, seal, label and cap the liquid version of the drug  its most popular form  in seconds. A year later, Norbeck quit her job at the hospital and in January of 2021 the duo founded Opio Connect Inc, with Norbeck as CEO and Pokorny as vice-president. They called the device they built Zing, and it came together quickly because it used parts developed for other kinds of machines. Existing pharmacy automation solutions werent built to handle the kind of variability that dispensing methadone requires, says Sam Wilson, Opios COO. So while the components of Zing existed, such as robotics, pumps, labeling tech, etc, no one had applied them to this particular challenge. The creation of Zing coincided with the rise of Covid-19, which provided a boost. Pre-pandemic, patients who were considered stable in their treatment could receive take-homes, allowing them to pick up seven or even 14 doses in one visit instead of making a daily trip to the clinic. To reduce in-person contact during the shutdown, federal administrators relaxed the rules on take-homes, making them available to a wider range of patients and in batches for up to 28 days. That policy shift led to more intensive prep and pouring for nurses, but post-Covid research showed that the change caused few problems and provided great benefits to patients, so the new take-home rules became permanent as of January 2024. Sign up to TechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion By then, the first Zing had arrived at CompDrug, an opioid treatment program in Columbus, Ohio, complete with its own nickname Alfie. The seven other Zings that have since come online around the country have likewise received monikers, and the humanizing effect has made them the subjects of naming votes, birthday parties, gender-reveal ceremonies and Halloween dress-up. Together, the fleet has assembled more than 1m doses of methadone. Norbeck expects 30 to 40 more Zings to land by the end of 2025, and the company has its eyes on the 2,100 clinics around the country as well as the prisons, where, she says, so many in the population need treatment, but theyre notoriously hard places to get nurses to work. Norbeck knows of no Zing-driven layoffs, but several clinics have been able to leave open positions unfilled and direct the saved money to other treatment programs. There were concerns that Zing would take nurses jobs, but the real mission is to free nurses up, says Pokorny. CompDrug once employed six nurses to pour and distribute methadone all day. Now, three handle the task, aided by a Zing, and the other three take telehealth appointments. All six are still on staff. At Man Alive, Bodhis arrival gave George enough free time that she also became the clinics home health nurse, helping patients connect with medical care and following up with them on medications and general healthcare issues. Of course, theres another side to those examples  the nurses who were not hired for open slots, telehealth roles or home health roles. Those jobs may have gone unfilled regardless of robot labor the Health Resources and Services Administration projects a shortage of 63,720 nurses in 2030, a number that does not capture the attrition accumulated through the pandemic. Norbeck sees her field as one in which robot labor can ease employment shortfalls rather than create them. In Baltimore, George and Man Alives other nurse, Mandy Scott, have even started holding educational events in the community and attending in-house group therapy sessions to further connect with patients. Put more simply, George says, Bodhi lets me be a nurse again.",0

Description: The rules-based world order is in retreat and violence is on the rise, forcing countries to rethink their relationships
Content: The rules-based world order is in retreat and violence is on the rise, forcing countries to rethink their relationships In a week in which former allies in a redividing globe separately commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, the sense of a runaway descent towards a third world war draws ever closer. The implosion of Pax Americana, the interconnectedness of conflicts, the new willingness to resort to unbridled state-sponsored violence and the irrelevance of the institutions of the rules-based order have all been on brutal display this week. From Kashmir to Khan Younis, Hodeidah, Port Sudan and Kursk, the only sound is of explosions, and the only lesson is that the old rules no longer apply. Indeed Fiona Hill, the policy analyst and adviser to the UK government on its imminent strategic defence review, argues the third world war has already started, if only we would recognise it. The fear of a world in which no one, due to science or globalisation, is any longer in control is hardly new the concept was the title of two Reith lectures, one in 1967 by the social anthropologist Edmund Leach and another in 1999 by the political philosopher Anthony Giddens. But rarely has been it so clear that the rules-based world order created in 1945 is in headlong retreat. The former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband put it well this week at Chatham House, saying I know that people always say the world is changing, but this feels like a moment of genuine geopolitical flux, at least as significant as 1989-90 when the world transitioned from the cold war to a unipolar moment, and for me the Trump administration is both symptom and cause of the changes under way. The problem is that its much more clear what we are inflecting from  a world in which the US was the anchor of the global system  but its not clear what were inflecting to. I know theres a lot of talk about the idea of a multipolar world reflecting a redistribution of the balance of power, but I find that concept conveying too much stability, too much security. His one-time mentor Tony Blair, in a talk in California, argued Everyone has been shaken out of their comfort zone. The noise you are hearing from the political undergrowth is the frantic foraging for options. People are rethinking their position in the world and their relationships. There is no doubt at all this is a major shock. This is the most significant geostrategic event I can remember in terms of America and the world. For the former US secretary of state Antony Blinken, Donald Trumps indifference to alienating allies is an act of vandalism. He said diplomats around the world were asking What the fuck is going on? Blinken said America had spent 80 years building up trust, strong economic partnerships and military and political alliances, and if that was then taken down in a matter of 100 days it would be incredibly hard to rebuild. It means countries look for ways to work around us, to work together but without the US, he said. The possibility that what will be said today will be reversed tomorrow, and will be reversed again, means they simply cannot count on us. Joe Biden used to say it is never a good idea to bet against America. The problem we now have is people are no longer betting on America. The doleful consequences of Americas withdrawal have been visible all week. It may or may not be a world war but it is a world at war. In Gaza the world has watched as a blockade on food, aid and medical supplies, in defiance of binding orders by the international court of justice ICJ, has now entered into its third month. Israel, in search of security, has in the past month bombed Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. It is daily urging the US to be given permission to bomb Iran. Trump can hardly complain when Bezalel Smotrich, Israels ultra-right finance minister, shared his vision for the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, predicting that within half a year the population of the territory would be confined to just a narrow swathe of land, with the remainder totally destroyed. Smotrich was only repeating a version of Trumps plan to empty Gaza of Palestinians, a plan totally at odds with the ceasefire terms his envoy had negotiated. In remarks at a settlements conference, Smotrich also declared that Israel would apply sovereignty in the West Bank within the lifetime of the current government, which is due to expire in October 2026 unless elections are called earlier. Within a few months, we will be able to declare that we have won. Gaza will be totally destroyed, Smotrich said. In another six months, Hamas wont exist as a functioning entity. With Trump silent, it was left to Europe to respond. It is time for the European Union and the entire international community to wake up, said the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot. He denounced the blockade as an absolute disgrace  It is not acceptable deliberately cutting off all humanitarian aid, all access to food, healthcare, electricity and water, as a war strategy, is totally unacceptable. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said If we condemn Russia for violating Ukrainian sovereignty, we cannot remain silent when it happens in Gaza. Hamas must be fought, yes, but not at the cost of trampling on all the rules. He called for a united response by Europe, yet at a foreign affairs meeting in Poland the 27 ministers could not even agree on a joint statement, let alone joint action to suspend its free trade agreement with Israel, a Dutch proposal. Meanwhile in Port Sudan, the conduit for humanitarian aid into Sudan, Rapid Support Forces drones destroyed infrastructure, just as Israeli bombs have sought to do this week in Hodeidah, the chief entry point for aid into Yemen. On Monday an effort by the Sudanese government to hold the United Arab Emirates accountable at the ICJ for directing arms to the RSF ended in failure. The UAE, like many other nations, is a signatory to the genocide convention, but it has entered a reservation insisting its compliance with the convention is not subject to ICJ proceedings. The ICJ meekly concluded there was a manifest lack of jurisdiction. Only one judge, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf from Somali, objected. So the UAE gains kudos of signing the convention without needing to be judged on meeting its obligations. It has been left to the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to make a valiant effort to coax the parties to a ceasefire, but so far it has foundered. The US, by contrast, labels RSF leaders as genocidal but does nothing in practical diplomatic terms. In Kashmir, where two nuclear-armed states are firing rockets at one anothers aircraft, there is a conspicuous absence of American interest. The US has no ambassador in India or Pakistan and no senior state department official appointed. The conflict is not making waves in US media, and Trumps initial response was its a shame and that if you think about it they have been fighting for many, many decades, and centuries, actually. In previous disputes between India and Pakistan it took a decisive US intervention to help calm both sides. In July 1999 in Washington, Bill Clinton personally browbeat Pakistans then leader, Nawaz Sharif, into retreat in what one official called the most important meeting with a foreign leader of Clintons presidency. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo revealed in his memoir how close the two sides came in February 2019 to a nuclear conflagration, something he frantically helped stop from a secure hotel room on a visit to Hanoi. Unnervingly, India is no longer framing the issue as terrorism but as a state-on-state dispute by saying the underlying issue is Pakistan acting as a shield for terrorism. These conflicts may be disconnected save the common thread of absent US leadership and permanent upheaval. But in Ukraine the structural elements of the world war come together, Hill argues. The scale of the death toll may be different to the second world war, but according to the UK military this week Russia has suffered 900,000 casualties, far in excess of its losses during previous wars in Chechyna and Afghanistan. Moreover, the wars are now, in her words, system-changing conflicts with multivector loads of countries involved. Chinese-flagged trawlers with Russians onboard rupturing undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is only one part of Vladimir Putins global war. China, North Korea and Iran are all supporting Russia, some in more material ways such as building drone factories or supplying soldiers. A host of other countries have been happy to keep Russia economically afloat in ways that make their neutrality contestable. India, with which the UK has completed a free trade deal this week, has bought 112bn of oil from Russia since the war started, and also bought Russian arms. The conflict has been presented by Russia and its allies as a war about American hegemony. Trump clearly had a plan to extricate the US from the line of fire and to put relations with Russia on a different footing, a desire he has nursed since the 1980s. Trump sees the world in similar terms to Putin  a handful of sovereign powers dividing up land into spheres of influence. His dream is to re-enact Yalta 1945 alongside Putin and possibly Xi Jinping, with Europe an onlooker and Ukraine dismembered. But organising a decent betrayal has proved more difficult than expected. In the White House, Trump famously told Volodymyr Zelenskyy You have to be thankful. You dont have the cards. But Trump overplayed the cards he had, throwing many of them away with his self-destructive tariff war. And it emerged that Zelenskyy did in fact have a few cards left, deploying them skilfully by offering a 30-day ceasefire, a minerals deal with the US, and focusing on Ukraines military value to western security. The intimate photo of Trump and Zelenskyy in conclave at the funeral of the pope a picture taken by Zelenskyys chief of staff, Andriy Yermak reeked of reconciliation yet flattered Trumps ego. A change in mood in Washington is now discernible. Even JD Vance, the vice-president, once agitator-in-chief against Zelenskyy, this week admitted Russia was asking for too much and said Europe and the US were on the same team. Europes leaders would dearly welcome that, but there is now a clarity across Europe, and not just in Paris, that regardless of Vances reassurance, Europe has to have the capability to operate autonomously of the US. Trump is self-evidently not reliable, and his benign assessment of Putins intentions is not shared. Planning for a European reassurance force in Ukraine is under way, as is planning for a potential Russian attack on Europe. Since February, France and the UK, through a combined joint expeditionary force, have formed the nucleus of that planning, but this has broadened, with new political leadership increasingly coming from four members of the Weimar group Poland, France, Germany and the UK. In a speech marking VE Day, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, explained the double necessity for Europe to be prepared for war. Russias war of aggression had shattered the European security order, with the imperial delusion that the war in Ukraine could be conflated with the great patriotic war. Then he added The fact that now even the United States, who did so much to create and shape this order, is turning its back on it is a shock on an entirely new scale. That is why I speak of a double epochal shift  Russias war of aggression and the US break with its values  that is what marks the end of this long 20th century. Europe, he insisted, must decide what comes next.",0
"Title: Head of Royal Navy suspended pending investigation
Description: Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, after MoD said he had departed for private reasons
Content: Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, after MoD said he had departed for private reasons The head of the Royal Navy has been suspended pending an investigation. Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, sources at the MoD confirmed on Friday. Key was absent from the lineup of senior military personnel on the Mall on Monday for celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, and it is understood that second sea lord V Adm Martin Connell has taken full charge until a permanent replacement is announced. Earlier this week the MoD said Key had departed for private reasons. Key joined the Royal Navy in 1984 as a university cadet, and graduated from Royal Holloway, University of London. As a junior officer he saw service around the world, after qualifying as helicopter aircrew and a principal warfare officer. He was made vice admiral in February 2016, before becoming the Royal Navys fleet commander and later chief of joint operations until he was appointed first sea lord in 2021. Over his career, he has commanded four ships the mine hunter HMS Sandown, the frigates HMS Iron Duke and HMS Lancaster, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. An Iraq war veteran, prior to taking over the Navy Key was also awarded a US bronze star and oversaw the retreat from Afghanistan. In his current role, he is also chief of the naval staff and chair of the navy board, where he is responsible to the secretary of state for the fighting effectiveness, efficiency and morale of the service. Key last year issued an unreserved apology for intolerable misogyny in the Submarine Service, after a series of investigations across the navy exposed sexual harassment, bullying and assault of women within its ranks. The navy chief said he was truly sorry to the women who had suffered misogyny, bullying and other unacceptable behaviours while serving their country. We must be better than this and do better than we have, he said. The MoD said on Friday An investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.",0
"Title: Outdated and unjust can we reform global capitalism?
Description: The long read President Trumps tariffs have plunged the world economy into chaos. But history counsels against despair  and the left should seize on capitalisms crisis of legitimacy
Content: President Trumps tariffs have plunged the world economy into chaos. But history counsels against despair  and the left should seize on capitalisms crisis of legitimacy Since Donald Trump launched his chaotic trade war earlier this year, it has become a truism to say he has plunged the world economy into crisis. At last months spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington, where policymakers and finance ministers from all over congregated, the attenders were shellshocked, the economist Eswar Prasad, a former senior IMF official who now teaches at Cornell, told me. The sense is that the world has changed fundamentally in ways that cannot easily be put back together. Every country has to figure out its own place in this new world order and how to protect its own interests. Trumps assault on the old global order is real. But in taking its measure, its necessary to look beyond the daily headlines and acknowledge that being in a state of crisis is nothing new to capitalism. Its also important to note that, as Karl Marx wrote in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please. Even would-be authoritarians who occupy the Oval Office have to operate in the social, economic and political environment that is bequeathed to them. In Trumps case, the inheritance was one in which global capitalism was already suffering from a crisis of legitimacy. Consider the decade before he was re-elected. In 2014, the global financial crisis and the Occupy Wall Street movement were fresh in the memory. The French economist Thomas Piketty appeared on bestseller lists around the world with his tome Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which highlighted income and wealth inequality. Bankers, billionaires and defenders of free market capitalism appeared to be on the defensive. Nobody believes any more in a moral revival of capitalism, wrote the German sociologist Wolfgang Streeck in the New Left Review. The attempt to prevent it from being confounded with greed has finally failed, as it has more than ever become synonymous with corruption. Move forward nine years to September 2023, and the 78th general assembly of the United Nations. Our world is becoming unhinged, António Guterres, the UNs secretary general, declared. Geopolitical tensions are rising. Global challenges are mounting. And we seem incapable of coming together to respond. Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal, mentioned the war in Ukraine and military coups in the Sahel, but the core challenges he cited were more systemic inequality, rising debt levels, authoritarianism, financial architecture that was dysfunctional, outdated and unjust, and the most immediate threat to our future our overheating planet. If the world didnt tackle these issues quickly, Guterres warned, it faced the prospect of a great fracture in economic systems and financial systems and trade relations. Declarations that global capitalism is in crisis are nothing new, of course. Ever since Marx and Engels Communist Manifesto, which appeared in 1848, critics have been predicting the systems demise. In the 1940s, two of capitalisms biggest champions  the Austrian free market economists Friedrich Hayek and Joseph Schumpeter  also argued that it was doomed. To them, the fatal threats were socialism and bureaucracy. During the post-second world war decades, many western countries moved in the direction of Keynesian social democracy, which was based on a social bargain between labour and capital, with restraints on the movement of financial capital. In the 1970s, this form of managed capitalism succumbed to whats known as stagflation, the combination of high inflation and stagnant economic growth. This was replaced with the neoliberal experiment in unrestricted financialisation and globalisation that met its nemesis in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. Since then, we have been in an interregnum characterised by the dominance of big tech, an intensifying climate crisis, a global pandemic and efforts across the political spectrum to imagine a new economic paradigm. Even in the United States, where the mythology of private enterprise runs deep and movements hostile to capitalism have long struggled to attract mass support, public attitudes have been changed. A 2023 opinion poll found that almost half of Americans, regardless of generation and race, say that capitalism is headed on the wrong path. In the same year, American Compass, a new conservative thinktank based in Washington DC, published a long report entitled Rebuilding American Capitalism A Handbook for Conservative Policymakers. What has happened to capitalism in America? Oren Cass, a Republican policy analyst who worked on Mitt Romneys 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, wrote in the introduction. Businesses still pursue profit, yes, but not in ways that advance the public interest  Globalisation crushed domestic industry and employment, leaving collapsed communities in its wake. Financialisation shifted the economys centre of gravity from Main Street to Wall Street, fuelling an explosion in corporate profits alongside stagnating wages and declining investment. Also in 2023, a report from another conservative American thinktank, the Edmund Burke Foundation, said that transnational corporations showing little loyalty to any nation damage public life by censoring political speech, flooding the country with dangerous and addictive substances and pornography and promoting obsessive, destructive personal habits. In some ways, these conservative criticisms echoed what leftists had been saying for generations. In others, they evoked the writings of the 19th-century arch-conservative Thomas Carlyle, who lamented the social degradations of industrial capitalism and described the pursuit of profit at any cost as One of the shabbiest gospels ever preached on earth. Conservatives were also having difficulty justifying the emergence of a new plutocracy whose conspicuous consumption evoked the Gilded Age captains of industry. Amazons Jeff Bezos took possession of a custom-built 417ft-long superyacht that came with a helipad-equipped support vessel and was rumoured to have cost 500m. Metas Mark Zuckerberg was building a 560-hectare compound in Hawaii that reportedly included a blast-proof underground bunker. It didnt take great observational powers to realise that Bezos, Zuckerberg and other tech barons were milking vast monopolies that were largely oblivious to competition, and, in the US at least, government oversight. The Covid shutdowns dealt another blow to champions of globalised capitalism by highlighting the dangers of relying on the profit motive to organise the production of vital goods. When the global supply chain froze up, many western countries were left short of items like respiratory masks, diagnostic testing kits, computer chips and baby formula. The industries at the centre of the supply chain  from shipping and rail to meat processing  had liberated themselves from rules imposed to limit their dominance, wrote the New York Times journalist Peter S Goodman in his illuminating 2024 book How the World Ran Out of Everything. They had reprised the era of the robber barons in achieving monopoly status. This had delivered stupendous profits to shareholders while yielding danger and dysfunction for society at large. Before the start of the pandemic, Trump had spent three years in office sounding off against the globalists. Although the trade restrictions he introduced during his first term were small beer compared with what he has unleashed in 2025, the difference can largely be ascribed to the fact that he was less sure of himself back then, and he took more notice of his advisers. But his political brand was built on a rejection of globalisation and free trade, and the institutions that underpinned them. During his 2016 presidential campaign, he labelled Nafta and the World Trade Organization a disaster and pledged to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that the Obama administration had negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim countries. This message resonated with voters who lived in manufacturing areas that had been exposed to cheap foreign competition, particularly from China. In a paper published after the 2016 election, the economists David H Autor, David Dorn, Gordon H Hanson and Kaveh Majlesi said they had identified a link between trade shocks and voting patterns in presidential elections going back to 2000. In areas of the US where there had been rising competition from imports, the Republican candidate gained more votes. The suggestion that trade and globalisation may have cost the Democrats the 2016 election was hotly disputed. Other studies found that race, religion and other cultural factors played a bigger role than economics in Trumps victory. But many Democrats interpreted his success as a rebuke of the pro-free trade policies that the party had adopted since the 1990s. When Joe Biden entered the White House in 2021, he left some of Trumps tariffs in place and introduced an ambitious industrial policy designed to boost US manufacturing and onshore production that had moved abroad. In 2024, before he left office, Biden raised some tariffs on Chinese goods to a rate of 100. Bidens levies were much more targeted than the blanket tariffs Trump has introduced in recent months. But they demonstrated that, at least as far as relations with China went, Washingtons abandonment of the open-trade model of global capitalism reflected a bipartisan consensus. Trump 2.0 represents a melange of populist economic nationalism, Silicon Valley accelerationism and feed-the-rich tax policies that can be traced back to Ronald Reagan. Each of these elements is supported by different interests with different goals, so it was predictable that the administration would be characterised by policy clashes and cognitive dissonance. Still, Trump himself has some clear goals. One of them, obviously, is enriching himself and his family, as evidenced by his embrace of crypto. According to a recent report by a watchdog group that tracks Trumps activities, the familys net worth has risen by 2.9bn during the past six months based on the market value of its various crypto investments. On a broader horizon, he is intent on reshaping global capitalism into a system of national or regional blocs, each protected by largely closed borders and high tariff walls. Efforts on the left to construct a new economic model are still very much a work in progress. To some environmentalist activists, climate breakdown demands that we abandon a central tenet of capitalism the notion that it can keep growing for ever. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you, Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish activist, said at a UN climate change summit in 2019. Thunberg has associated herself with degrowth, an international movement whose intellectual origins lie in the Limits to Growth debate of the 1970s. The modern degrowth movement encompasses some different viewpoints, but they all reject maximising GDP growth as the primary goal of economic policy. The faster we produce and consume goods, the more we damage the environment, Giorgos Kallis, an ecological economist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, wrote in his 2018 book Degrowth. If humanity is not to destroy the planets life support systems, the global economy should slow down. Some western governments, and the World Bank, have endorsed green growth  the idea that the development of renewable energy sources and the spread of electronic vehicles, heat pumps and other clean technologies will allow rising GDP to decouple from higher emissions. Some green growth enthusiasts point to the United Kingdom, which cut its carbon emissions in half between 1990 and 2022, even as its inflation-adjusted GDP rose by about 80. This reduction was achieved largely by eliminating coal-fired power stations and replacing them with a combination of renewable energy sources and natural gas. In April 2024, 59 of Britains electricity came from renewables. Sceptics of green growth point out that most rich countries havent matched the UKs performance and that the developed world, taken as a whole, had failed abjectly to meet the commitments it made in the 2015 Paris agreement, which were designed to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. At the achieved mitigation rates, these countries would on average take more than 220 years to reduce their emissions by 95, emitting 27 times their remaining 1.5C fair-shares in the process, Jason Hickel, an anthropologist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, and Jefim Vogel, a PhD student at the University of Leeds, wrote in a study published in The Lancet Planetary Health in 2023. The degrowth movement isnt just about tackling the climate crisis. It draws on an intellectual tradition of scepticism towards industrial capitalism and mass production that dates back to Carlyle, John Ruskin, the Indian economist JC Kumarappa, who advised Gandhi, and EF Schumacher, the author of the 1973 book, Small is Beautiful. In his 2017 book Prosperity Without Growth, Tim Jackson, an ecological economist at the University of Surrey, called on advanced countries to shift their economies towards local services, such as nursing and teaching, and the development of more rewarding and less resource intensive professions like handicrafts. People can flourish without endlessly accumulating more stuff, Jackson wrote. Another world is possible. Yet proposals to abandon economic growth have also been met with scepticism. As the Oxford economist Wilfred Beckerman pointed out in the 1970s, strong growth during the postwar era helped raise wages and keep distributional conflicts in check the subsequent slowdown coincided with rising political polarisation. At the global level, the key issue is whether degrowth would impose intolerable burdens on the worlds poorest countries, which would love to follow the growth paths that China and India have trodden in recent decades. And it isnt just the poorest countries that want to grow faster. On a global basis, according to the World Bank, the median household income in 2022 was just 7.75 a day. In a 2021 blogpost, Branko Milanović, an economist specialising in inequality, explored two options for keeping global GDP constant, which is the most literal definition of degrowth. The first involved freezing world income distribution, so that everybody kept their current incomes. In this scenario, Milanović pointed out, about half the worlds population would be forced to live permanently on seven dollars a day or less, which surely wouldnt be acceptable. The second option involved reducing the living standards of people with incomes above the global average and raising the living standards of those below the average. According to Milanovićs calculations, this policy would affect anyone living on more than 16 dollars a day. In western countries thats about 86 of the population. The degrowthers cannot condemn to perpetual poverty people in developing countries who are just seeing the glimpses of a better life, nor can they reasonably argue that incomes of 9 out of 10 westerners ought to be reduced, Milanović wrote. The way out of the impasse is to engage in semi-magical and then outright magical thinking. Degrowthers contest this, of course. But on much of the left the focus is on making growth greener rather than abandoning it, and on trying to address other enduring problems, including poverty, stagnant wages, monopoly power and tax avoidance by the rich. In a 2019 essay, Economics After Neoliberalism, the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik, Columbias Suresh Naidu and Berkeleys Gabriel Zucman presented an extensive list of policy ideas, including establishing wage boards in low-wage industries to rein in employers market power expanding early childhood education programmes as a means of raising the lifetime incomes of children from poor families tackling tax avoidance by taxing multinational corporations where they make their sales reforming the patent system to reduce the monopoly power of big pharma and other intellectual property holders beefing up international financial regulation and including labour standards in trade agreements. The assumption underlying this expansive agenda is that there is no quick fix for 21st-century capitalism the entire system needs a makeover. Referring to the work of Karl Polanyi, the Austro-Hungarian economic historian who regarded the free market as a utopian pipe dream, Rodrik, Naidu and Zucman wrote These proposals take Polanyis words to heart. To work well, crucial markets including markets for labour, land and capital must be embedded in nonmarket institutions, and the rules of the game must be supplied by government. The mention of Polanyi was a reminder of what is at stake in these policy debates. In containing capitalism within a new set of rules and social norms, postwar Keynesian social democracy seemingly refuted Polanyis argument, which he made during the 1930s, that socialism or fascism was the logical end point of the system. Keynesianism established a middle ground. But when neoliberalism supplanted it, capitalism again broke free of its bounds, with disastrous results. The challenge now facing the centre-left is to construct a new managed capitalism for a globalised, tech-dominated and finance-driven world in which the labour movement is nowhere near as powerful as it was in the middle of the 20th century. In a paper published in 2021, the economists Samuel Bowles, of the Santa Fe Institute, and Wendy Carlin, of University College London, argued that efforts to build a new economic paradigm should be organised around shrinking capitalism to a diminished space where it could do less damage, and its strengths, such as its capacity to spur innovation, would serve the community. Political and economic forces were aligning with this new paradigm, the two economists argued. Concerns about the climate emergency and inequality were undermining support for capitalism in general terms, while the rise of AI and robotics was undermining the traditional hierarchical capitalist firm, in which workers carried out routine, preassigned tasks for a set wage or salary. More flexible forms of economic organisation were emerging, such as open-source collaborations and the gig economy, in which many workers were nominally self-employed. Bowles and Carlin werent endorsing the practices of platform companies, like Uber and Lyft, that rely on gig workers. They were arguing that technology-driven capitalism was, to some extent, eating itself, and that this cannibalisation was creating space for alternative economic models, including some that have long existed but could in the future have broader appeal, such as not-for-profits, worker-owned cooperatives and community-organised public commons. This is a confluence that could propel a new paradigm in political economy to dominance, the article concluded. Perhaps a new economic paradigm will emerge, but Trumps re-election and the rising support for rightwing populism in other western countries, including Britain, raises the question of what sort of paradigm it will be. When the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci was languishing in Mussolinis prisons during the 1920s and 30s, he thought deeply about the relationship between broad economic forces and economic ideologies. In the prison notebooks he kept, he remarked how in certain circumstances the forces and ideologies come together in a historical bloc that can exercise political power through consent rather than force, a phenomenon he referred to as hegemony. The managed capitalism of the postwar era was based on a bloc that combined blue-collar workers and their liberal-minded allies from the professional classes, domestically focused businesses, long-term capital and Keynesiansocial democratic policy ideas. The globalised hypercapitalism of the post-cold war era was based on internationally minded businesses, educated workers whose jobs couldnt be displaced by low-wage foreign competition, footloose capital and free market ideology. As we enter the second quarter of the 21st century, the question is what sort of bloc can exercise power in a world shrunken by digital technology but splintered by nationalism. Chinese state capitalism arguably represents one candidate, but its undemocratic nature has blunted its appeal to other countries. So has the slowdown in the Chinese economy since Xi Jinping took over in 2012. Trumpian economic nationalism is another contender. His return to the White House on a platform of tariffs and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, which appeals to nativist voters and domestically oriented businesses, demonstrated that his victory in 2016 wasnt a fluke. To be sure, the presence in Trumps circle of Elon Musk and various Wall Street tycoons who have benefited enormously from globalisation and financialisation highlights the glaring contradictions in the Maga movement, as does Trumps commitment to preserving the regressive tax cuts that Congress passed during his first term. But none of this has prevented him and his allies from positioning themselves as outsiders attacking a corrupt establishment. This political confidence trick is embodied in the figure of JD Vance, Trumps vice-president, who once worked for a venture capital firm and defended globalisation but now positions himself as an ersatz philosopher of the new right. At the 2024 Republican National Convention, Vance stated blithely, Were done  catering to Wall Street. Well commit to the working man. On the far left, replacing capitalism remains the ultimate goal. But with the exception of a few places, such as depressed parts of East Germany, there is little popular enthusiasm for reviving the communist model of state ownership and central planning. Many leftists are more interested in creating new institutions and communities that operate independently of the monolithic capitalist economy and the state, such as protest encampments, bartering and recycling networks, communal farms, and small-scale artisanal enterprises. Even though early 19th century figures like Robert Owen, William Thompson and Charles Fourier no longer figure prominently on the left, the goal of creating communities and subeconomies that operate beyond the cash nexus goes back to their efforts to create new cooperative communities. Two centuries on, their descendants have yet to demonstrate how they would overcome the practical problems that plagued their predecessors, especially if their ideas were applied at the national or global level. But the lure of what Silvia Federici, the co-creator of the Wages for Housework movement, has described as a new commons is a timeless one. For what the commons in essence stands for, Federici wrote, is the recognition that life in a Hobbesian world, where one competes against all and prosperity is gained at the expense of others, is not worth living and is a sure recipe for defeat. The idea of shrinking capitalism seems like one that a broad range of people on the left and centre-left could unite around, from Federici to Bowles and Carlin to Joseph Stiglitz, the American liberal economist. In his 2024 book The Road to Freedom Economics and the Good Society, Stiglitz called for a decentralised economy with a rich ecology of institutions. Noting the many encroachments that capitalism had made in recent decades, he wrote, There must be large parts of the economy that are not and cannot be driven by profits. These include much of the health, education and care sectors, in which the narrow pursuit of profits often leads to perverse results. Stiglitz also called for restrictions on the activities of platform monopolies, particularly social media companies, arguing that their algorithms had enabled the incitement of violence and the spread of hate speech and induced antisocial behaviour. Some of Stiglitzs criticisms chimed with those of Federici, others with elements of the Edmund Burke Foundations report. This was a hopeful sign for efforts to create a broad coalition to rein in hypercapitalism. But no one should underestimate the opposition that such a project would face from big businesses that, in the US especially, can spend unlimited sums of money to influence the political system, and from longstanding defenders of the free market. In July 2023, dozens of the latter  including Jeb Bush, Karl Rove, and representatives of the Mont Pelerin Society, the American Enterprise Institute and the Capitalist League  issued a statement of principles proclaiming The free enterprise system is the foundation of prosperity. During the 1930s, American conservatives issued similar arguments in opposing FDRs New Deal. In the early 1940s, Hayek issued his warning that the shift toward collectivism could lead to serfdom. More recently, many American conservatives have criticised the government response to the Covid 19 pandemic, which included large stimulus programmes. It wasnt perfect, but it headed off a lengthy slump, and, in some of its particulars, it was highly illuminating. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 converted an existing programme of tax credits for low-paid workers with children into a monthly universal cash benefit of 300 per child. In the year after this policy was introduced, the rate of child poverty, as measured by the Census Bureaus Supplemental Policy Measure, fell from 9.7 to 5.2. In 2022, when the expanded tax credits were eliminated, the child poverty rate shot back up to 12.4  the biggest one-year increase on record. The lesson was clear it is perfectly possible to reduce child poverty, just as it was possible in the 20th century to reduce old-age poverty by introducing state pensions. Capitalism can be reformed the challenge is to summon the will and the means to do it. With the rise of rightwing populism, AI, and a techfinance oligarchy that is openly exerting its political influence, the task can seem more formidable than ever. But history counsels against despair. For more than 200 years, industrial capitalism has evolved in waves and counterwaves, some of which are driven by its inner conflicts, some by technological developments and others by political mobilisation. At any moment, its difficult if not impossible to tell how long the current configuration will survive, or what will succeed it. But the capitalist system isnt handed down from the heavens and it cannot rest. This has been true throughout its existence. It will remain true until the critics who predict capitalisms demise are eventually proved right.

"Title: Are we heading for another world war  or has it already started?
Description: The rules-based world order is in retreat and violence is on the rise, forcing countries to rethink their relationships
Content: The rules-based world order is in retreat and violence is on the rise, forcing countries to rethink their relationships In a week in which former allies in a redividing globe separately commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, the sense of a runaway descent towards a third world war draws ever closer. The implosion of Pax Americana, the interconnectedness of conflicts, the new willingness to resort to unbridled state-sponsored violence and the irrelevance of the institutions of the rules-based order have all been on brutal display this week. From Kashmir to Khan Younis, Hodeidah, Port Sudan and Kursk, the only sound is of explosions, and the only lesson is that the old rules no longer apply. Indeed Fiona Hill, the policy analyst and adviser to the UK government on its imminent strategic defence review, argues the third world war has already started, if only we would recognise it. The fear of a world in which no one, due to science or globalisation, is any longer in control is hardly new the concept was the title of two Reith lectures, one in 1967 by the social anthropologist Edmund Leach and another in 1999 by the political philosopher Anthony Giddens. But rarely has been it so clear that the rules-based world order created in 1945 is in headlong retreat. The former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband put it well this week at Chatham House, saying I know that people always say the world is changing, but this feels like a moment of genuine geopolitical flux, at least as significant as 1989-90 when the world transitioned from the cold war to a unipolar moment, and for me the Trump administration is both symptom and cause of the changes under way. The problem is that its much more clear what we are inflecting from  a world in which the US was the anchor of the global system  but its not clear what were inflecting to. I know theres a lot of talk about the idea of a multipolar world reflecting a redistribution of the balance of power, but I find that concept conveying too much stability, too much security. His one-time mentor Tony Blair, in a talk in California, argued Everyone has been shaken out of their comfort zone. The noise you are hearing from the political undergrowth is the frantic foraging for options. People are rethinking their position in the world and their relationships. There is no doubt at all this is a major shock. This is the most significant geostrategic event I can remember in terms of America and the world. For the former US secretary of state Antony Blinken, Donald Trumps indifference to alienating allies is an act of vandalism. He said diplomats around the world were asking What the fuck is going on? Blinken said America had spent 80 years building up trust, strong economic partnerships and military and political alliances, and if that was then taken down in a matter of 100 days it would be incredibly hard to rebuild. It means countries look for ways to work around us, to work together but without the US, he said. The possibility that what will be said today will be reversed tomorrow, and will be reversed again, means they simply cannot count on us. Joe Biden used to say it is never a good idea to bet against America. The problem we now have is people are no longer betting on America. The doleful consequences of Americas withdrawal have been visible all week. It may or may not be a world war but it is a world at war. In Gaza the world has watched as a blockade on food, aid and medical supplies, in defiance of binding orders by the international court of justice ICJ, has now entered into its third month. Israel, in search of security, has in the past month bombed Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. It is daily urging the US to be given permission to bomb Iran. Trump can hardly complain when Bezalel Smotrich, Israels ultra-right finance minister, shared his vision for the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, predicting that within half a year the population of the territory would be confined to just a narrow swathe of land, with the remainder totally destroyed. Smotrich was only repeating a version of Trumps plan to empty Gaza of Palestinians, a plan totally at odds with the ceasefire terms his envoy had negotiated. In remarks at a settlements conference, Smotrich also declared that Israel would apply sovereignty in the West Bank within the lifetime of the current government, which is due to expire in October 2026 unless elections are called earlier. Within a few months, we will be able to declare that we have won. Gaza will be totally destroyed, Smotrich said. In another six months, Hamas wont exist as a functioning entity. With Trump silent, it was left to Europe to respond. It is time for the European Union and the entire international community to wake up, said the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot. He denounced the blockade as an absolute disgrace  It is not acceptable deliberately cutting off all humanitarian aid, all access to food, healthcare, electricity and water, as a war strategy, is totally unacceptable. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said If we condemn Russia for violating Ukrainian sovereignty, we cannot remain silent when it happens in Gaza. Hamas must be fought, yes, but not at the cost of trampling on all the rules. He called for a united response by Europe, yet at a foreign affairs meeting in Poland the 27 ministers could not even agree on a joint statement, let alone joint action to suspend its free trade agreement with Israel, a Dutch proposal. Meanwhile in Port Sudan, the conduit for humanitarian aid into Sudan, Rapid Support Forces drones destroyed infrastructure, just as Israeli bombs have sought to do this week in Hodeidah, the chief entry point for aid into Yemen. On Monday an effort by the Sudanese government to hold the United Arab Emirates accountable at the ICJ for directing arms to the RSF ended in failure. The UAE, like many other nations, is a signatory to the genocide convention, but it has entered a reservation insisting its compliance with the convention is not subject to ICJ proceedings. The ICJ meekly concluded there was a manifest lack of jurisdiction. Only one judge, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf from Somali, objected. So the UAE gains kudos of signing the convention without needing to be judged on meeting its obligations. It has been left to the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to make a valiant effort to coax the parties to a ceasefire, but so far it has foundered. The US, by contrast, labels RSF leaders as genocidal but does nothing in practical diplomatic terms. In Kashmir, where two nuclear-armed states are firing rockets at one anothers aircraft, there is a conspicuous absence of American interest. The US has no ambassador in India or Pakistan and no senior state department official appointed. The conflict is not making waves in US media, and Trumps initial response was its a shame and that if you think about it they have been fighting for many, many decades, and centuries, actually. In previous disputes between India and Pakistan it took a decisive US intervention to help calm both sides. In July 1999 in Washington, Bill Clinton personally browbeat Pakistans then leader, Nawaz Sharif, into retreat in what one official called the most important meeting with a foreign leader of Clintons presidency. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo revealed in his memoir how close the two sides came in February 2019 to a nuclear conflagration, something he frantically helped stop from a secure hotel room on a visit to Hanoi. Unnervingly, India is no longer framing the issue as terrorism but as a state-on-state dispute by saying the underlying issue is Pakistan acting as a shield for terrorism. These conflicts may be disconnected save the common thread of absent US leadership and permanent upheaval. But in Ukraine the structural elements of the world war come together, Hill argues. The scale of the death toll may be different to the second world war, but according to the UK military this week Russia has suffered 900,000 casualties, far in excess of its losses during previous wars in Chechyna and Afghanistan. Moreover, the wars are now, in her words, system-changing conflicts with multivector loads of countries involved. Chinese-flagged trawlers with Russians onboard rupturing undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is only one part of Vladimir Putins global war. China, North Korea and Iran are all supporting Russia, some in more material ways such as building drone factories or supplying soldiers. A host of other countries have been happy to keep Russia economically afloat in ways that make their neutrality contestable. India, with which the UK has completed a free trade deal this week, has bought 112bn of oil from Russia since the war started, and also bought Russian arms. The conflict has been presented by Russia and its allies as a war about American hegemony. Trump clearly had a plan to extricate the US from the line of fire and to put relations with Russia on a different footing, a desire he has nursed since the 1980s. Trump sees the world in similar terms to Putin  a handful of sovereign powers dividing up land into spheres of influence. His dream is to re-enact Yalta 1945 alongside Putin and possibly Xi Jinping, with Europe an onlooker and Ukraine dismembered. But organising a decent betrayal has proved more difficult than expected. In the White House, Trump famously told Volodymyr Zelenskyy You have to be thankful. You dont have the cards. But Trump overplayed the cards he had, throwing many of them away with his self-destructive tariff war. And it emerged that Zelenskyy did in fact have a few cards left, deploying them skilfully by offering a 30-day ceasefire, a minerals deal with the US, and focusing on Ukraines military value to western security. The intimate photo of Trump and Zelenskyy in conclave at the funeral of the pope a picture taken by Zelenskyys chief of staff, Andriy Yermak reeked of reconciliation yet flattered Trumps ego. A change in mood in Washington is now discernible. Even JD Vance, the vice-president, once agitator-in-chief against Zelenskyy, this week admitted Russia was asking for too much and said Europe and the US were on the same team. Europes leaders would dearly welcome that, but there is now a clarity across Europe, and not just in Paris, that regardless of Vances reassurance, Europe has to have the capability to operate autonomously of the US. Trump is self-evidently not reliable, and his benign assessment of Putins intentions is not shared. Planning for a European reassurance force in Ukraine is under way, as is planning for a potential Russian attack on Europe. Since February, France and the UK, through a combined joint expeditionary force, have formed the nucleus of that planning, but this has broadened, with new political leadership increasingly coming from four members of the Weimar group Poland, France, Germany and the UK. In a speech marking VE Day, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, explained the double necessity for Europe to be prepared for war. Russias war of aggression had shattered the European security order, with the imperial delusion that the war in Ukraine could be conflated with the great patriotic war. Then he added The fact that now even the United States, who did so much to create and shape this order, is turning its back on it is a shock on an entirely new scale. That is why I speak of a double epochal shift  Russias war of aggression and the US break with its values  that is what marks the end of this long 20th century. Europe, he insisted, must decide what comes next.",0
"Title: Head of Royal Navy suspended pending investigation
Description: Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, after MoD said he had departed for private reasons
Content: Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, after MoD said he had departed for private reasons The head of the Royal Navy has been suspended pending an investigation. Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to step back as first sea lord, sources at the MoD confirmed on Friday. Key was absent from the lineup of senior military personnel on the Mall on Monday for celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, and it is understood that second sea lord V Adm Martin Connell has taken full charge until a permanent replacement is announced. Earlier this week the MoD said Key had departed for private reasons. Key joined the Royal Navy in 1984 as a university cadet, and graduated from Royal Holloway, University of London. As a junior officer he saw service around the world, after qualifying as helicopter aircrew and a principal warfare officer. He was made vice admiral in February 2016, before becoming the Royal Navys fleet commander and later chief of joint operations until he was appointed first sea lord in 2021. Over his career, he has commanded four ships the mine hunter HMS Sandown, the frigates HMS Iron Duke and HMS Lancaster, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. An Iraq war veteran, prior to taking over the Navy Key was also awarded a US bronze star and oversaw the retreat from Afghanistan. In his current role, he is also chief of the naval staff and chair of the navy board, where he is responsible to the secretary of state for the fighting effectiveness, efficiency and morale of the service. Key last year issued an unreserved apology for intolerable misogyny in the Submarine Service, after a series of investigations across the navy exposed sexual harassment, bullying and assault of women within its ranks. The navy chief said he was truly sorry to the women who had suffered misogyny, bullying and other unacceptable behaviours while serving their country. We must be better than this and do better than we have, he said. The MoD said on Friday An investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.",0
"Title: Whiplash reversals mean Trumps erratic trade policy is as clear as mud
Description: The specifics of the administrations economic masterplan  from strollers to movies to China  change by the day
Content: The specifics of the administrations economic masterplan  from strollers to movies to China  change by the day Decades of economic orthodoxy failed millions of Americans, according to Donald Trump, who marched back into the White House promising to shred the status quo. But the specifics of his alternative  exactly how his administration claims it will make America great again  change by the day. The US president declared this week to be a key milestone of his second term, as he unveiled his first major trade deal since returning to office following accelerated talks with the UK. But it came as Trumps position, on everything from tariffs on strollers and movies to whether his administration even wants to strike such global deals, appeared to shift by the hour. Firms across the world have been trying to come to terms with the rapid rate of presidential kneejerks where policies can be announced, adjusted and shelved as quickly as the leader of the free world can publish a social media post. Theres so much uncertainty, Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair and persona non grata in Trumpworld, observed on Wednesday. If you talk to businesses, or market participants, or forecasters, everyone is just waiting to see how developments play out. Take strollers. This was the week when Trump argued that some prices are more important than others. After pledging to bring down prices, the president was keen to focus on those that had fallen during an NBC News interview that aired last weekend. His interviewer, however, observed that some had risen with an estimated 97 of strollers bought in the US made in China, for example, prices have risen significantly since Trump hiked tariffs dramatically on the country. The president was having none of it. The declining price of fuel is thousands of times more important than a stroller, he asserted. Later in the interview, he demanded more positive questions. Because you know what? Gasolines big business, he said. A stroller is not big business. On Sunday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Sure, strollers might be more expensive  but thats peanuts in the grand scheme of things. Other costs are thousands of times more important. By Wednesday, the administration was moving in a different direction. Potential tariff exemptions for childcare and baby products  like car seats, cribs and, yes, strollers  were under consideration, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told Congress. Then there was movies. This was also the week when Trump emphatically stood up for Hollywood. The president abruptly announced his concern that Hollywood was DYING a very fast death over the weekend. A 100 tariff would be imposed upon any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands, he wrote on Truth Social. Many US blockbusters are produced, shot and edited in a variety of countries. There was no detail as to how the policy would be executed. It was unclear which films would and would not face tariffs. Sign up to Trump on Trial Stay up to date on all of Donald Trumps trials. Guardian staff will send news and updates directly to your inbox. after newsletter promotion But on Sunday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Hollywood had been devastated by the rise of movie production elsewhere this amounted to a national security threat and US officials would immediately start work on steep tariffs. By Monday, the administration was moving in a different direction. The White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that no final decisions had been made, and the administration was exploring all options. And take deals. This was also the week when Trump, author of Trump The Art of the Deal, announced he was done with them. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised to negotiate agreements that would end wars and tilt the world economy in his countrys favor. But earlier this week, surrounded by cameras in the Oval Office, the president complained the media had become fixated. You keep writing about deals, deals, he told reporters. I wish theyd stop asking how many deals are you signing this week? because one day, well come and well give you a hundred deals. And they dont have to sign. And I think my people havent made it clear, said the president. While the US will sign some deals, tariffs were a much bigger focus. Overseas companies are going to have to pay to shop in the US, he added. Think of us as a super luxury store. On Tuesday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Trade deals were not the be-all and end-all. The US will make demands of trading partners, and unless they agree, it will continue to hit them with sweeping tariffs. By Thursday, the administration was moving in a different direction. Unveiling a maxed-out deal that were going to make bigger, Trump declared that a trade accord with the UK would be just the first. In reality, the UK-US deal was unfinished. The announcement felt hasty the diplomatic equivalent of hosting a wedding reception after the engagement, but before the ceremony. Both Trump and Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, conceded certain details had yet to be finalized. But the president was off  many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good GREAT! ones, he wrote on Truth Social the following day  which brings us to China. No economy has been targeted more aggressively, or hit harder, by this administration. Trump has insisted any pain, be it higher prices or empty shelves, would be worth bearing as Washington pushed back hard against Beijing. IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID, he wrote of his tariff strategy in February. Trump sparked a trade war between the worlds two largest economies by ramping up US tariffs on Chinese goods to 145, prompting swift retaliation. They deserve it, he told ABC News last week. They were ripping us off like nobodys ever ripped us off. But today, the administration appears to be moving in a different direction. Bessent has been dispatched to Geneva to negotiate with Chinese officials. The president, who has for months maintained that the US must hold the line against China, stressed the treasury secretary was leading these talks  but threw in his two cents. 80 Tariff on China seems right, he wrote on Truth Social, proposing a drastic reduction. Up to Scott B. What happens next is anyones guess. But its safe to say it probably wont be up to Scott B.",0
"Title: Irans FM visits Saudi Arabia, Qatar before nuclear talks with US in Oman
Description: The Iranian Foreign Ministry has confirmed there will be a technical delegation at the Iran-US talks on Sunday.
Content: The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed there will be a technical delegation at the Iran-US talks in Oman on Sunday. Irans Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has visited Saudi Arabia and is due to visit Qatar for consultations in the run-up to the fourth round of indirect nuclear talks with the United States, which will take place in Oman on Sunday. The future direction of Irans nuclear programme, its enrichment of uranium, and sanctions relief remain the key issues. Araqhchis Gulf tour on Saturday comes after Tehran confirmed the latest round Friday The negotiations are moving forward, and naturally, the further we go, the more consultations and reviews are needed, Araghchi said in remarks carried by Iranian state media. Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said on Friday that, after coordination with both Iran and the US, the delayed talks would go ahead in Muscat. The fourth round, initially scheduled for May 3 in Rome, was postponed for what Oman described as logistical reasons. A source familiar with the matter said on Friday that US President Donald Trumps special envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to attend the meeting in Oman. The talks come against the backdrop of a long-running dispute over Irans nuclear ambitions. The meeting is the latest effort to revive diplomacy after years of rising tensions. Successive US administrations have sought to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. A sustained effort by world powers during the Barack Obama administration culminated with a 2015 agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA. The multilateral agreement created a framework for Iran to receive much-needed relief from international sanctions, in exchange for reducing its uranium enrichment and submitting to inspections of its nuclear facilities. But when Trump succeeded Obama as US president, he unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear agreement in 2018, causing the deal to crumble. Some Western countries argue that Irans programme, accelerated after the US walkout from the 2015 accord, is aimed at developing weapons. Tehran maintains that its nuclear activity is entirely civilian. Trump himself has acknowledged tensions in his policy on Iran, saying at the start of his second term that hawkish advisors were pushing him to step up pressure reluctantly. In an interview on Thursday, Trump said he wanted total verification that Irans contested nuclear work is shut down, but through diplomacy. Id much rather make a deal than see military action, Trump told the conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt. There are only two alternatives  blow em up nicely or blow em up viciously, Trump said. In an interview with Breitbart News on Friday, Witkoff said the US would take Iran at their word that they do not want nuclear weapons, but set out specific conditions for verifying such a position. If thats how they feel, then their enrichment facilities have to be dismantled. They cannot have centrifuges. They have to downblend all of their fuel that they have there and send it to a faraway place  and they have to convert to a civil programme if they want to run a civil programme, he said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier raised the possibility of Iran importing enriched uranium for any civilian energy. Araqchis trips to Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Saturday are part of what he describes as continuous consultations with neighbouring states. He said the visits aimed to address concerns and mutual interests regarding the nuclear issue. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei confirmed the presence of a technical delegation in the talks in Oman on Saturday. In an interview with Mehr News, Baghaei stated that the Iranian delegation is comprised of experts and specialists relevant to the current phase of the negotiations. He did not comment on the US team. Follow Al Jazeera English",0
"Title: China, US hold talks on tariffs in first bid to de-escalate trade war
Description: Analysts have low expectations of a breakthrough, but host Switzerland hopes road map will emerge.
Content: Analysts have low expectations of a breakthrough, but host Switzerland hopes roadmap will emerge. Chinas trade envoy He Lifeng has met United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland for talks aimed at easing a trade war between the superpowers that is roiling global markets. The first official engagement, since the US slapped a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods, prompting a retaliatory 125 percent duty from China, began on Saturday at an undisclosed location in Geneva, Switzerland, according to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua. A motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in the suburb of Cologny, The Associated Press news agency reported. A diplomatic source, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon. The trade dispute, which effectively amounts to a mutual boycott of products, was prompted by US President Donald Trump last month when he announced sweeping duties on almost every country in the world, which are now subject to a 90-day reprieve while negotiations take place. Experts believe China may be looking for the same 90-day waiver as well as a reduction of the 145 percent tariff  Trump suggested that it could be reduced to 80 percent, saying in a Truth Social post on Friday that the amount seems right. Trumps press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Friday that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally, adding that China would need to make concessions as well. Bessent has said the meetings in Switzerland would focus on de-escalation. The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the  tariffs at the same time, said Sun Yun, director of the China programme at the Washington, DC-based Stimson Center, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. It cannot just be words, she said. Trump has justified the punitive tariff by citing unfair trade practices and accusing Beijing of failing to curb the export of chemicals used to produce fentanyl, a lethal synthetic opioid. China, for its part, says it will not bow to imperialists and bullies. With distrust running high, both sides have been keen not to appear weak, and economic analysts have low expectations of a breakthrough. Trump has suggested the discussions were initiated by China. Beijing said the US requested the discussions and that Chinas policy of opposing US tariffs had not changed. Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin met both parties in Geneva on Friday and said the fact that the talks were taking place was already a success. If a roadmap can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions, he told reporters on Friday, saying talks could continue into Sunday or even Monday.

"Title: Netanyahus war choices fuel discord in Israel over captives fate in Gaza
Description: Israeli reservists increasingly refuse duty, citing exhaustion from repeated tours supporting a war with no clear end.
Content: Israeli reservists increasingly refuse duty, citing exhaustion from repeated tours supporting a war with no clear end. To prioritise the release of the captives in Gaza, or to continue fighting what critics are calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus forever war  that is the question increasingly dividing Israel. Israels government, laser-focused on the idea of a total victory against Hamas in Gaza, appears to be opting for the latter. And that is only increasing the criticism Netanyahu has received since October 2023, firstly for his governments failure to stop the October 7 attack, and then for failing to end a now 19-month war, or provide a clear vision for what the day after in Gaza will look like. Netanyahus decision in March to unilaterally end a ceasefire instead of continuing with an agreement that would have brought home the remaining captives has widened the cracks within Israeli society, as opponents realised that the likelihood of the captives leaving Gaza alive was becoming more remote. In recent weeks, a wave of open letter writing from within military units has emerged protesting the governments priorities. The discontent has also gained traction with the public. Earlier this month, thousands of Israelis gathered outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv to protest against Netanyahus decision to call up a further 60,000 reservists as part of his escalation against the bombed out and besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where his forces have already killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children. In mid-April, current and former members of the air force, considered one of Israels elite units, also released a letter, claiming the war served the political and personal interests of Netanyahu, and not security ones. Prompted by the air force, similar protests came from members of the navy, elite units within the military and Israels foreign security agency, Mossad. Political and personal interests Accusations that Netanyahu is manipulating the war for his own personal ends predate the breaking of the ceasefire. In the minds of his critics, the longer the war continues, the longer Netanyahu feels he can defend himself against the numerous threats to his position and even his freedom. In addition to facing trial on numerous counts of corruption dating back to 2019, he also faces calls to hold an inquiry into the governments political failings before the October 7 attack. Netanyahu also faces accusations that members of his office have allegedly been taking payment from Qatar  the Gulf state has previously dismissed the allegations as a smear campaign intended to hinder efforts to mediate an end to the conflict. The continuation of the war allows Netanyahu to distract from those issues, while maintaining a coalition with far-right parties who have made it clear that any end to the war without total victory  which increasingly appears to include the ethnic cleansing of Gaza  would result in their departure from government, and Netanyahus likely fall. And so there are questions about whether Netanyahus announcement of a further escalation in Gaza, including the occupation of territory and displacement of its population, will mark an end to the conflict, or simply bog Israel down in the kind of forever war that has so far been to Netanyahus benefit. I dont know if theyre capable of occupying the territory, former US Special Forces commander, Colonel Seth Krummrich of international security firm Global Guardian told Al Jazeera, Gaza is just going to soak up people, and thats before you even think about guarding northern Israel, confronting Iran or guarding the Israeli street, he said, warning of the potential shortfall in reservists. Its also competing with a tide of growing domestic toxicity. When soldiers dont return home, or dont go, thats going to tear at the fabric of Israeli society. It plays out at every dinner table. Staying at home Israeli media reports suggest that part of that toxicity is playing out in the number of reservists simply not showing up for duty. The majority of those refusing service are thought to be grey refusers. That is, reservists with no ideological objection to the mass killings in Gaza, but rather ones exhausted by repeated tours, away from their families and jobs to support a war with no clear end. Official numbers of reservists refusing duty are unknown. However, in mid-March, the Israeli national broadcaster, Kan, ran a report disputing official numbers, which claimed that more than 80 percent of those called up for duty had attended, suggesting that the actual figure was closer to 60 percent. There has been a steady increase in refusal among reservists, a spokesperson for the organisation New Profile, which supports people refusing enlistment, said. However, we often see sharp spikes in response to specific shifts in Israeli government policy, such as the violation of the most recent ceasefire or public statements by officials indicating that the primary objective of the military campaign is no longer the return of hostages and destruction of Hamas, as initially claimed, but rather the occupation of Gaza, and its ethnic cleansing. Also unaddressed is growing public discontent over the ultra-religious Haredi community, whose eight-decade exemption from military service was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court in June of last year. Despite the shortfall in reservists reporting for duty and others having experienced repeated deployments, in April, the Supreme Court requested an explanation from Netanyahu  who relies upon Haredi support to maintain his coalition  as to why its ruling had not been fully implemented or enforced. Throughout the war, Netanyahus escalations, while often resisted by the captives families and their allies, have been cheered on and encouraged by his allies among the far-right, many of whom claim a biblical right to the homes and land of Palestinians. The apparent conflict between the welfare of the captives and the total victory promised by Netanyahu has run almost as long as the conflict itself, with each moment of division seemingly strengthening the prime ministers position through the critical support of the ultranationalist elements of his cabinet. Netanyahus position has led to conflict with politicians, including his own former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. While Gallant wasnt opposed to the war in principle  his active support for Netanyahu eventually led to him joining Netanyahu in facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes  his prioritisation of the captives put him at odds with the prime minister. The divide over priorities has meant that civility between the government and the captives families has increasingly gone out the window, with Netanyahu generally avoiding meeting families with loved ones still captive in Gaza, and far-right politicians engaging in shouting matches with them during meetings in parliament. Division within Israeli society was not new, Professor Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House told Al Jazeera, but wars and conflicts deepen them. Now we have a situation where some people have served anywhere up to 400 days in the army as reservists, while others are refusing to serve at all and exploiting their political power within the coalition to do so, Mekelberg added. Elsewhere, there are ministers on the extreme right talking about sacrificing the hostages for military gain, something Mekelberg said many regarded as running counter to much of the founding principles of the country and the Jewish faith. Theres such toxicity in public discourse, Mekelberg continued, We see toxicity against anyone who criticises the war or the prime minister, division between the secular and the religious, and then even divisions within the religious movements.

"Title: Qatar leads Syria search for bodies of US hostages killed by ISIL Report
Description: The search and rescue group has found the remains of three unidentified bodies so far, according to anonymous sources.
Content: The search and rescue group has found the remains of three unidentified bodies so far, according to anonymous sources. A Qatari mission has begun searching for the remains of United States hostages killed by the ISIL ISIS armed group in Syria about 10 years ago, according to the Reuters news agency, citing two sources briefed on the mission. Qatars International Search and Rescue Group began the search on Wednesday, with the help of several US nationals who wished to remain anonymous, the news agency reported. So far, three unidentified bodies have been found by the group, according to the sources. The missions focus was on locating the body of aid worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded by ISIL in 2014 in Dabiq, northern Syria, a Syrian security source told Reuters. US aid worker Kayla Mueller as well as US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were among other Western hostages killed by ISIL. Foley and Sotloff were confirmed killed in 2014. Muellers killing was confirmed in 2015. Were grateful for anyone taking on this task and risking their lives in some circumstances to try and find the bodies of Jim and the other hostages, said Diane Foley, James Foleys mother. We thank all those involved in this effort. The Qatari mission is getting under way as US President Donald Trump prepares to visit Doha and other Gulf Arab capitals next week and as Syrias new government seeks relief from sanctions imposed by the US. Washington, along with some other Western governments, has said it will wait to see how the new authorities exercise their power and ensure human rights before lifting any sanctions. The United Kingdom last month removed its sanctions on 12 Syrian government entities, including the Ministries of Defence and Interior and the General Intelligence Directorate. ISIL once controlled vast swaths of Syria and Iraq, ruling over millions of people. At the peak of its power from 2014-2017, it beheaded numerous people in captivity, including Western hostages, and released videos of the killings. A coalition of more than 80 countries, led by the US, was formed to fight ISIL in September 2014. The war against the group officially ended in March 2019, when US-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz, the last sliver of land ISIL controlled. Plans for the Qatari mission were discussed during a visit to Washington in April by Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and State Minister Mohammed Al Khulaifi  a trip also designed to prepare for Trumps visit to Qatar, one of the sources told Reuters. Another person familiar with the issue said there had been a longstanding commitment by successive US administrations to find the remains of the murdered US nationals, and that there had been multiple previous efforts with US government officials on the ground in Syria to search very specific areas. The person did not elaborate, the report said. But the US has had hundreds of soldiers deployed in northeastern Syria that have continued pursuing ISILs remnants. The person said the remains of Kassig, Sotloff and Foley were most likely located in this part of the country. Muellers case was different as she was in the custody of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the person added. Two ISIL members, both former UK citizens who were part of a cell dubbed the Beatles that beheaded US hostages, are serving life prison sentences in the US. Follow Al Jazeera English",0
"Title: Pakistan launches Operation Bunyan Marsoos What we know so far
Description: Pakistan and India fired missiles at each others airbases in the latest escalation between the neighbours.
Content: Pakistan and India fired missiles at each others airbases in the latest escalation between the neighbours. Islamabad, Pakistan  India and Pakistan fired missiles at each others military bases on Saturday morning, the latest escalation in their rapid drift towards an all-out war. Pakistan accused India of carrying out attacks inside its territory for the fourth consecutive night, launching ballistic missile strikes on at least three air bases. Islamabad said that in response, it launched a major military campaign, Operation Bunyan Marsoos Arabic for a structure made of lead targeting at least six Indian military bases. India, in turn, accused Pakistan of being the aggressor. Indian military officials claimed Pakistan had targeted several Indian military bases and that its missiles into Pakistani territory were in response. Yet, regardless of who hit the other first on May 10, the very fact that India and Pakistan had struck each others military bases over such a wide swath of territory, well beyond Kashmir  the disputed region that they each partly control  means that the conflict has now veered into almost unknown territory. Never have the South Asian rivals attacked each other on this scale outside the four wars they have fought. Here is what we know so far about Indias attacks, Pakistans response, what both countries and global powers like the United States are saying, and the background to this intensifying conflict. Pakistan said that India launched a salvo of drones into Pakistan, followed by ballistic missile strikes on at least three major airbases. The Pakistani bases India targeted are Pakistan said that in response, it launched aerial attacks against multiple Indian military bases. The bases known to have been targeted are At a media briefing, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of provocations and escalations, claiming that New Delhi was only responding to its neighbours actions. He was joined by Colonel Sofia Qureshi of the Indian Army and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force, who shared New Delhis version of events. Pakistan, Qureshi said, used drones, long-range weapons, loitering munitions and fighter aircrafts to target civilian areas and military infrastructure. Pakistan military also resorted to air intrusions using drones and firing of heavy calibre weapons along the Line of Control, she said. Loitering munitions, also known as suicide drones, are remote-controlled and designed to crash into their targets. The Line of Control is the de facto border between Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. While India said it had shot down most incoming missiles and drones, Qureshi and Singh conceded that the air force bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj did suffer limited damage. India, however, rejected suggestions that any bases had suffered any significant damage, with the military releasing time-stamped photos of the facilities in support of its assertion. Pakistans military had on Thursday claimed that the Udhampur and Pathankot bases had been destroyed. Indian officials said at least five people had been killed by Pakistani missile fire on Saturday. As the neighbours traded missile fire and allegations, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with General Syed Asim Munir, Pakistans army chief and widely regarded as the countrys most powerful figure, as well as with the Indian foreign minister, S Jaishankar. According to the US State Department, Rubio urged both parties to seek ways to deescalate and offered American assistance in launching constructive dialogue to avoid further conflict. Pakistans military response on Thursday followed four days of consecutive Indian attacks inside its territory and came two weeks after a deadly assault on tourists in the scenic town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22. The attack killed 26 men, all civilians. India blamed armed groups it alleges are backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad has denied, calling instead for an impartial, transparent investigation that New Delhi has rejected. Multiple witness accounts suggest the gunmen segregated the men from the women, then selected and killed non-Muslims. India initiated strikes on May 7, targeting areas inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It claimed to have destroyed terrorist infrastructure and eliminated at least 100 terrorists. It called its attacks Operation Sindoor, a reference to the vermilion  sindoor in Hindi  the red pigment many married Hindu women apply to their foreheads. The missions name was an allusion to the manner in which gunmen killed tourists in Pahalgam. Pakistan reported that the Indian strikes killed 33 people, including several children, and injured more than 50. It denied that any of the dead were fighters, as India claimed. As the attacks unfolded, Pakistan deployed its air force in response, engaging in a battle with the Indian Air Force IAF. Pakistans military claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales, the French-made aircraft considered the IAFs most advanced assets. India has neither confirmed nor denied the losses. India responded by deploying drones and loitering munitions on May 9 and 10, hitting at least a dozen targets across Pakistan, including major urban centres such as Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. India said the drone strikes were in response to Pakistans use of drones, a claim Islamabad continues to reject. There is no credence to their claims. They continue to lie. Their allegation is false. Otherwise, where is their evidence? Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, Pakistans military spokesperson, told Al Jazeera during a news briefing in Rawalpindi on Friday. He added that Pakistans response to Indian aggression would come at a time, method, and place of our choosing. That time came on the morning of May 10. Pakistans operation is titled Bunyan Marsoos, an Arabic phrase that translates as a structure made of lead. The phrase originates from the Quran Truly God loves those who fight in His cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure. In its Quranic context, the phrase symbolises unity and strength among believers fighting for a righteous cause. Experts have repeatedly warned of the need for immediate de-escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours before the situation becomes irreversible. India said on May 10 that it was willing to stop the cycle of escalation if Pakistan reciprocated. But Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said Indian strikes on Pakistani airbases had dramatically escalated the conflict. With Pindi being hit and other airbases such as the one in Sargodha, the war has taken a turn for the worse, he told Al Jazeera. We are now looking at a much bigger-scale war. Muhammad Faisal, a South Asia security analyst at the University of Technology Sydney, said Pakistan was left with little choice but to respond forcefully. Pakistan can employ its latest jets in standoff mode or launch long-range missile strikes on Indian airbases that bypass air defences. During the last three days, both sides have significantly mapped each others air defences, and now the next round of escalation is here, he told Al Jazeera. Follow Al Jazeera English",0
"Title: Children among 13 killed in Israels attacks on Gaza amid aid blockade
Description: Cancer and diabetes patients among those suffering from Israels ban on entry of all items, including medicine, in Gaza.
Content: Cancer and diabetes patients among those suffering from Israels ban on entry of all items, including medicine, in Gaza. At least 13 people, including three children, have been killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip amid a months-long Israeli blockade that has deepened the humanitarian crisis in the war-torn coastal enclave. Palestinian news agency Wafa said Israeli warplanes bombed a tent in the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday morning, killing five members of the Tlaib family. Three children, their mother and her husband were sleeping inside a tent and were bombed by an Israeli occupation aircraft, family member Omar Abu al-Kass told the AFP news agency. The strikes came without warning and without having done anything wrong, added Abu al-Kass, who said he was the childrens maternal grandfather. In parallel, a drone attack on Gaza Citys Tuffah neighbourhood left six people dead and one more in the Sheikh Radwan area of the city where Israel bombed an apartment belonging to the Zaqout family. Further south, Wafa said Israeli gunboats opened heavy fire on the shores of Rafah, killing a man identified as Mohammed Saeed al-Bardawil. Two more civilians were injured in an attack on the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, west of Rafah. In the past 24 hours, at least 23 Palestinians have been killed and 124 others injured in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, according to the enclaves Health Ministry. The attacks came amid Israels continuing refusal to allow vital supplies into Gaza since March 2, leaving the enclaves 2.3 million residents dependent on a dwindling number of charity kitchens, which have been shutting down in recent days as food runs out. Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeeras Hind Khoudary said Theres barely food  Were talking about bakeries not operating, were talking about zero distribution points and were talking about only a few hot meal kitchens still operating. Khoudary said people queueing for hours would often leave empty-handed, with remaining kitchens stretching out food that would previously have fed 100 to serve up to 2,000 people. Were seeing more people dying, were seeing more children dying due to malnutrition and the lack of food. But its not only the lack of food, its also the lack of medical supplies, its the lack of fuel, cooking gas and its the lack of everything, she said. Among the charities shuttering operations, the United States-based World Central Kitchen said on Wednesday that it had been forced to close down because it no longer had supplies to bake bread or cook meals. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for the blockade to be lifted. Children are starving, and dying. Community kitchens are shutting down. Clean water is running out, it said on Friday in a post on X. The blockade is also having a devastating effect on people with chronic illnesses, depriving Palestinians who suffer from diabetes, cancer and rare conditions, of life-saving medication. Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeeras Hani Mahmoud said Doctors here say the tragedy is not in whats happening, but in what is preventable. These diseases have a treatment, but people of Gaza no longer have access to them, and they say that this is not just a failure of logistics, but of humanity, he added. Mahmoud spoke to the father of a 10-year-old boy suffering from diabetes, who said insulin was not available across northern Gaza. I spend entire days searching pharmacies, hoping to find it. Sometimes we hear that individuals might have it, so I go to their homes to barter, he said. Said al-Soudy, head of emergency in the oncology department of Gaza Citys Al Helou International Hospital, told Al Jazeera A large part of patients are struggling to find their essential medications. Without them, their health conditions deteriorate and may become life-threatening. Pharmacist Rana Alsamak told Al Jazeera that Palestinians were unable to obtain medication for multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, chronic illnesses and  immune-related diseases. These conditions now go largely untreated, she said. On Friday, the United States said it was establishing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza, with Israel providing military security for operations. The United Nations rejected the move, saying it would weaponise aid, violate principles of neutrality and cause mass displacement. Follow Al Jazeera English",0
"Title: Ford to raise prices on three cars produced in Mexico RPT
Description: The increased price tag is a result of US President Donald Trumps imposed tariffs on auto imports.
Content: The increased price tag is a result of Trumps tariffs on auto imports which car companies ultimately will pass on to consumers for cars that will hit dealer lots in June. Ford Motor Company has raised prices for three of its vehicles produced in Mexico, becoming one of the first major carmakers to adjust sticker prices following US President Donald Trumps tariffs. The new prices took effect on vehicles produced on May 2 or later, according to the news agency Reuters, which first reported the story on Wednesday. Prices on the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up  one of its most affordable and popular vehicles and Bronco Sport will increase by as much as 2,000 on some models, according to a notice sent to dealers, which was reviewed by Reuters. A Ford spokesperson said the cars with the raised price tag would arrive at dealer lots in late June. Ford said the trade war would add about 2.5bn in costs for 2025, but it expects to reduce that exposure by about 1bn. General Motors said last week that tariffs were projected to cost it between 4bn and 5bn following the imposition of hefty levies on foreign imports of automobiles, but it expected to offset that by at least 30 percent. Trumps tariffs have unleashed weeks of uncertainty across the auto sector, as major carmakers in the United States and Europe have pulled forecasts, shifted production and caused companies to idle plants. Following weeks of pushback from the auto industry, Trump softened his tariffs on foreign auto parts imports to give carmakers credits for what is produced in the US and to avoid double-tariffs on raw materials used in production. However, the White House has not rescinded a 25-percent tariff on the 8 million vehicles the US imports annually. Ford is in a better position to weather tariffs than some of its competitors because of its strong US manufacturing base. The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker assembles 79 percent of its US-sold vehicles domestically, compared with GMs 53 percent, according to an analyst note from Barclays. Ford and GM also face significant levies on imports from China and South Korea, respectively. GM estimated that the costs on its Korean imports totalled about 2bn, while Ford declined to specify the expenses around importing vehicles from China. Automakers that rely on exports to the US are facing increased pricing pressure. A dozen major carmakers, including Toyota and GM, import at least 40 percent of the vehicles they sell in the US, with some, such as Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor, importing more than 60 percent, according to 2024 data from SP Global Mobility. Before Fords move, most carmakers had not taken the step of boosting prices, but had warned that it was on the way. Porsche said it would have to boost its selling cost if tariffs remained in place, while US Volkswagens Audi brand also suggested potential price increases, without providing any details. By contrast, BMW expects US car tariffs to decline from July, based on its contacts with US officials  a more upbeat assessment of the trade climate than many rivals. GMs finance chief, Paul Jacobson, told analysts last week that the automaker was not expecting imminent price increases, saying they feel good about where the pricing environment is today.

"Title: Trump to announce trade deal with UK on Thursday, reports say
Description: Reports come after US president teased the announcement of agreement with an unnamed country.
Content: Reports come after US president teased the announcement of agreement with an unnamed country. United States President Donald Trump is set to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom on Thursday, US media have reported, in what would be the first such agreement since he rolled out his sweeping tariffs. The reports come after Trump on Wednesday teased the announcement of a deal with an unnamed country on social media. Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 1000 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. THE FIRST OF MANY!!! The New York Times, which reported the news along with The Wall Street Journal, Politico and CNN, said that it was not clear whether the agreement had been finalised. Investors have been anxiously waiting for signs of an easing of Trumps trade war amid fears that prolonged uncertainty over tariffs could inflict serious damage to the global economy. The International Monetary Fund last month lowered its global growth forecast for 2025 from 3.3 percent to 2.8 percent amid Trumps trade salvoes. On Tuesday, US and Chinese officials confirmed that they would hold their first round of trade talks in Switzerland this weekend, raising hopes of a breakthrough in the de facto mutual trade embargo between the worlds two largest economies. The UK was spared from Trumps reciprocal tariffs announced against dozens of countries last month, but its exports have been subject to a 10 percent baseline duty since April 9. The US and UK did 314.6 billion pounds 419bn worth of trade in goods and services in 2024, an increase of 3.9 percent from the previous year, according to the UKs Department for Business and Trade. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier this week announced the finalisation of a landmark trade deal with India that he said would add 4.8 billion pounds 6.4bn a year to the economy.

"Title: China says it is evaluating Trump administrations outreach on tariffs
Description: Ministry of Commerce says door is open to talks, but it is willing to fight to the end otherwise.
Content: Ministry of Commerce says door is open to talks, but it is willing to fight to the end otherwise. China has said it is considering proposals by the United States to begin negotiations on US President Donald Trumps sweeping tariffs. The US has recently, through relevant channels, actively conveyed messages to China, expressing a desire to engage in talks, Chinas Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Friday. China is currently evaluating this. Beijings remarks come after Chinese state media reported earlier in the week that the Trump administration had proactively reached out through multiple channels. Trumps trade war with China has resulted in a de facto mutual trade embargo between the worlds two largest economies. Businesses and investors have been anxiously waiting for signs that Washington and Beijing will ease their steep tariffs on each others goods amid fears that a protracted standoff will inflict serious damage on the global economy. The International Monetary Fund last month lowered its global growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8 percent, down from 3.3 percent in January, while JPMorgan Chase has put the likelihood of a US recession this year at 60 percent. Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial services company in Beijing, said that China appears to be sincere about being open to talks provided the US is serious. Again, theyve got a lot of tools The tariffs are already in place, but they also have export controls and can launch more probes into US companies, Beddor told Al Jazeera. The list goes on. Most importantly, theyre ready to stimulate to blunt the damage to economic growth. But policymakers also clearly understand that it would be a lot better if they didnt have to use those tools because there was a de-escalation. Trump, who has slapped a 145 percent tariff on Chinese exports, has repeatedly insisted that his administration is in negotiations with Beijing, a claim that Chinese officials have rejected as groundless. On Wednesday, Trump said there was a very good chance he would reach a trade deal with China, so long as it was fair. In its statement on Friday, Chinas Commerce Ministry said that its stance on the trade dispute had been consistent. If there is a fight, we will fight to the end if there are talks, the door is open, the ministry said. The tariff war and trade war were unilaterally initiated by the US, and if the US wants to talk, it should demonstrate sincerity by preparing to correct its erroneous actions and rescind the unilateral imposition of additional tariffs, it said, adding that attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and blackmail would not work with China. In an interview with Fox News that aired on Thursday night, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Trumps tariffs were badly hurting the Chinese economy and Beijing was eager to talk. The Chinese are reaching out, they want to meet, they want to talk, Rubio told Fox News host Sean Hannity. Weve got people involved in that. Rubio also said that the tensions were a wake-up call for the US, and the country should not be as dependent on China. Two more years in this direction, and we are going to be in a lot of trouble, really dependent on China, he said. So, I do think there is this broader question about how much we should buy from them at all. Steven Okun, the CEO of Singapore-based consultancy APAC Advisors, said it would not be a surprise to see meetings between Chinese and US officials given the interdependence of their economies and the damage being done to both, but characterising such contact as a negotiation would be premature.

"Title: Two-thirds of global warming caused by worlds richest 10, study finds
Description: Study authors argue progressive taxes on wealth and carbon-intensive investments could provide a solution.
Content: Study authors argue progressive taxes on wealth and carbon-intensive investments could provide a solution. The wealthiest 10 percent of the worlds people are responsible for two-thirds of the global warming since 1990, according to researchers. The way in which the rich consume and invest has substantially increased the risk of heatwaves and droughts, wrote the researchers of a study published on Wednesday in the monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Climate Change. This is the first study to quantify the impact of concentrated private wealth on extreme climate events. We link the carbon footprints of the wealthiest individuals directly to real-world climate impacts, lead author Sarah Schoengart, a scientist at the public university of ETH Zurich, told the AFP news agency. Its a shift from carbon accounting toward climate accountability. Compared with the global average, for example, the richest 1 percent contributed 26 times more to once-a-century heatwaves and 17 times more to droughts in the Amazon, according to the study. Emissions from the wealthiest 10 percent in China and the United States  which together account for nearly half of global carbon pollution  each led to a two- to threefold rise in heat extremes. If everyone had emitted like the bottom 50 percent of the global population, the world would have seen minimal additional warming since 1990, co-author Carl-Friedrich Schleussner said. Addressing this imbalance is crucial for fair and effective climate action. Burning fossil fuels and deforestation have heated Earths average surface by 1.3 degrees Celsius 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit, mostly during the past 30 years. Schoengart and her colleagues combined economic data and climate simulations to trace emissions from different global income groups and assess their impact on specific types of climate-enhanced extreme weather. The researchers also emphasised the role of emissions embedded in financial investment rather than just lifestyle and personal consumption. The impact of this consumption and investment is particularly severe in tropical regions such as the Amazon, Southeast Asia and Southern Africa  all areas of the world that have historically contributed the least to global emissions but have been disproportionately impacted by extreme weather. Our study shows that extreme climate impacts are not just the result of abstract global emissions. Instead we can directly link them to our lifestyle and investment choices, which in turn are linked to wealth, Schoengart said. We found that wealthy emitters play a major role in driving climate extremes, which provides strong support for climate policies that target the reduction of their emissions. The authors argued that targeting the financial activities and investment portfolios of high-income individuals could lead to significant climate gains. Climate action that doesnt address the outsized responsibilities of the wealthiest members of society risk missing one of the most powerful levers we have to reduce future harm, Schleussner said. Owners of capital, he noted, could be held accountable for climate impacts through progressive taxes on wealth and carbon-intensive investments, thus providing much needed support for adaptation and damage in vulnerable countries. Earlier research has shown that taxing asset-related emissions is more equitable than broad carbon taxes, which tend to burden those with lower incomes. Recent initiatives to increase taxes on the superrich and multinationals have mostly stalled, especially since US President Donald Trumps return to power in January. In 2021, nearly 140 countries agreed to work towards a global corporate tax for multinational companies with nearly half endorsing a minimum rate of 15 percent, but those talks have stalled as well. According to the antipoverty NGO Oxfam, the richest 1 percent have accumulated 42 trillion in new wealth over the past decade. It says the richest 1 percent have more wealth than the lowest 95 percent combined. Follow Al Jazeera English",0
"Title: Fact check Has Canadian tourism to Florida dropped by 80 percent?
Description: Congressman Jared Moskowitz claimed fewer Canadians are travelling amid Trumps 51st-state comments.
Content: Congressman Jared Moskowitz claimed fewer Canadians are travelling amid Trumps 51st state comments. But has tourism slumped by that much? Canadians have long spent wintertime in Florida, trading in frigid temperatures for the Sunshine States sunny beaches and spending money in restaurants and hotels that cater to Canadian tourists. But President Donald Trumps rhetoric and actions targeting Canada have given some Canadians pause about spending money in the United States. Trump has repeatedly said Canada should become the 51st US state, called then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a governor and enacted substantial tariffs. Canadians replied, excusez-moi? and, on April 28, elected Prime Minister Mark Carneys Liberal Party. And according to a Florida congressman, many Canadians also ditched their Florida travel plans. In a May 1 interview with Representative Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, CNNs Wolf Blitzer said he had heard from friends in Boca Raton, Florida, that many Canadians are not travelling to the state because of Trumps actions. Blitzer asked Moskowitz Have you noticed a drop in Canadian tourism to Florida? Moskowitz said Its 80 percent less is what were seeing in the travel data. When we asked Moskowitzs team for comment, his spokesperson Christopher Bowman said Moskowitz referred to an April 2 report by WPTV, the NBC affiliate in West Palm Beach. The WPTV report said, Airline reservations from Canada to Florida are down 76 percent this April compared to April 2024. WPTVs report cited OAG, an aviation firm. In a blog post, the firm said April bookings recorded in March for the entire US-Canada market were down 75.7 percent compared with March 2024. It did not report Florida-specific numbers. OAG said the nationwide drop suggests that travellers are holding off on making reservations, likely due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the broader trade dispute. We found other sources of data pointing to a decline in Canadian visitors to Florida, but by much less than the 80 percent cited by Moskowitz. In 2024, more Canadians travelled to Florida by air 2.1 million than by other means 1.1 million, such as road travel, according to Visit Florida, the states tourism arm. Statewide estimated visitor data for the first quarter of 2025 wont be available until May 15, according to Visit Florida. In 2024, about 3.27 million Canadians visited Florida, representing about 2 percent of tourists to the state. Governor Ron DeSantiss office said in April that in January and February, Florida saw a 0.5 percent increase in Canadian air visitation compared with the same months in 2024. Aviation firms and airports have said theyve seen decreases. OAG Chief Analyst John Grant told PolitiFact that in early March, there were 698,000 scheduled airline seats, or seats made available by airlines, between Canada and Florida from May to August. That now stands at 628,000, so a reduction of 10 percent, he said. He noted that his firms data includes anyone booked on a flight between Canada and the US, so a traveller could be a connecting passenger from China travelling via Vancouver to Denver, for instance. Courtney Miller, founder of aviation data firm Visual Approach Analytics, told PolitiFact that Canadian airline seats to Florida are down by 13 percent for May and 10 percent for June compared with the same periods in 2024. I have not seen any data that suggest 80 percent, Miller said. We are seeing overall Canadian travel to the entire US down no more than 25 percent. A Visual Approach Analytics analysis showed that from January to March 27, two Florida airports  Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Orlando International Airport  had the biggest decrease in monthly arrivals from Canadian airlines, at 20 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Other Florida areas are also experiencing declines in travel. Fort Myers and Palm Beach are down 30 percent and 43 percent, respectively, compared to April schedules as they existed on January 1, 2025, the analysis said. A Miami International Airport spokesperson told PolitiFact that from January 1 to April 23, the number of arriving passengers from Canada was down 5.9 percent. National data for Canada-US road travel also shows a drop. US Customs and Border Protection data shows about 4.1 million travellers arriving from the northern border in March 2025, compared with 4.9 million the same time last year  a 17.4 percent decrease. The data doesnt specify whether the travellers entered the US as tourists. Richard Clavet, a longtime owner of Hollywood, Florida, motels and hotels, said his properties for years have attracted Canadians who gather at the pool or Friday night hot dog cookouts. Clavet told PolitiFact he saw a drop in Canadian visitors starting in February. A lot of them were blaming it on the political situation, said Clavet, who is originally from Quebec. They were not happy with the way Trump was talking about their prime minister. They wanted to boycott the US and make a statement so a lot of them cancelled. Clavet estimated that in recent months the number of Canadians staying in his properties was 50 percent less than last winter. Usually, Canadians rush to book for the following year, but that hasnt happened this year, Clavet said. They want a piece of the sun where its safe, the weather is great, thats what I have been working on for so many years, Clavet said. I really enjoyed dealing with Canadians hopefully they will come back. Moskowitz said Canadian tourism to Florida has declined by 80 percent. His office pointed to information from a TV report, which cited information from aviation data firm OAG. The firm said April airline bookings recorded in March for the entire US-Canada market were down 75.7 percent compared with 2024. It did not report Florida-specific numbers. Other data sources confirm a drop in Canadian tourism to Florida, but by far less than the percentage cited by Moskowitz. For example, individual airports in Florida cited declines from 6 percent to 43 percent over a few months. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Follow Al Jazeera English",0
"Title: India, UK agree historic trade deal including tariff cuts
Description: Both sides celebrate the landmark agreement, which was several years in the making.
Content: Both sides celebrate the landmark agreement, which was several years in the making. India and the United Kingdom have agreed to a trade deal that comes after three years of negotiations and that they say will boost their economies amid the fallout from US President Donald Trumps tariffs. The British government said on Tuesday that the deal is expected to increase bilateral trade by 25.5 billion pounds 34bn, UK GDP by 4.8 billion pounds 6.4bn and wages by 2.2 billion pounds 2.9bn each year in the long run. Indian tariffs will be slashed, locking in reductions on 90 percent of tariff lines, with 85 percent of these becoming fully tariff-free within a decade. The British alcohol and car industries are some of the main beneficiaries, with tariffs on whisky and gin getting halved to 75 percent before reducing to 40 percent by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will go from over 100 percent to 10 percent under a quota. Tariffs will also be reduced on British exports including cosmetics, medical devices, aerospace parts, lamb, salmon, chocolate, and biscuits. Indias Trade Ministry said 99 percent of Indian exports would face no import duty under the deal. This brings us closer to our goal of becoming a global economic powerhouse. It protects our core interests while opening doors to Indias greater participation in global value chains, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said. The deal introduces a Double Contribution Convention that exempts Indian workers in the UK from national insurance payments for up to three years, and vice versa. Advanced negotiations on a separate bilateral investment treaty and further discussions on labour and environmental standards are ongoing as well. Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Keir Starmer spoke on the phone on Tuesday to mark the agreement, and Modi invited Starmer to visit the country. These landmark agreements will further deepen our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies, Modi said in a post on X. Strengthening our alliances and reducing trade barriers with economies around the world is part of our Plan for Change to deliver a stronger and more secure economy here at home, said Starmer, hailing what the government says is the UKs largest trade agreement since leaving the European Union in 2020. The two leaders are expected to meet in the coming months to sign and finalise the deal. India also sought to receive an exemption from the UKs forthcoming carbon tax  a climate policy tool set to be implemented from 2027  but officials did not elaborate on the details in their statements on Tuesday. The deal comes as countries around the world are pondering new strategies and negotiating trade deals to make up for the costs of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in the United States.

It is not easy to keep the audience intact with the content and storyline for this long time period. Recently, a new promo for the show has dropped and it shows that there will be another leap. Honestly, it becomes tough to even count which leap number is this, because there have been several to keep the show going. Here are a few reasons for why the show seems to be more stretchy rather than being sensible.
Content: Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai has been one of the longest Hindi daily soaps that has been running over for more than twelve years and has the maximum number of episodes. It is not easy to keep the audience intact with the content and storyline for this long time period. Recently, a new promo for the show has dropped and it shows that there will be another leap. Honestly, it becomes tough to even count which leap number is this, because there have been several to keep the show going. Here are a few reasons for why the show seems to be more stretchy rather than being sensible. Kartik has gotten married on the show for more than we can count. Kartik and Nairas grand wedding was always used to grab back the audience with their fairy tale romance. After Nairas death track same happened with Kartik and Sirat. Kartik and Sirats wedding plot was also very twisted to keep the viewers intact to see their favourite couple back together, hence stretching the story Starting off with portrayal of nice family problems and genuine drama, the show has scooped down to the typical saas-bahu drama in order to add spice and keep the audience intact somehow. The sweet innocent Akshara keeping the family together to the drama by the Goenkas and several marriages of different characters on the show time and again, the show has become more of a dram house than a loved family show. It has lost original identity in order to remain on screen for the longest time. Though Indian drama soaps are too dramatic and unrealistic at times, but time and again YRKKH has bought up plots that seemed to be fully detached from the real world. Tracks like Aksharas blind sight coming back to normal, Sirats career as a professional boxer, Naira pretending to be dead for over five years and rejoining the family are a few storylines that seem to be more dramatic than realistic. Extending several plots just to stretch the number of episodes have resulted in unrealistic scenarios in the show. YRKKH has been following repetitive plots and it has been no secret from anyone. From Kartik-Narias numerous separation tracks to gain back the TRPs to Naira and Kartiks journey of parenthood, the stories have been very similar. Kartik and Nairas parenthood ride was pretty similar to one that was showcased for Naitik and Akshara with the five-year leap, losing of babies, abortion, etc. the show has again proven to be stretchy rather being original. Actors quitting the show and others replacing them is quite common, however in a long family running show like YRKKH, audiences get quite used to the characters and actors who are playing the role. Several replacements for Naksh like first Rohan Mehra, then Rishi Dev, and then Shehzad Shaikh. For a lead character like Naitik, post Karan Mehra quoting the show, Vishal Singh was bought in while Modena Singh who played the role of Kirti Goenka was replaced by Harsha Khandeparkar. Gayu aka Gayatri Singhania was replaced not once but twice. From Kanchi Singh to Deblina Chatterjee to Simran Khanna. Leaps are important for any show, particularly an Indian daily soap. But YRKKH has taken many leaps. Several leaps with intervals like Naksh-Naira grown-up, Kartik-Nairas leap for Mumbai track, yet again leap for Nairas death track, so on and so forth. Its been noticed that as soon as the story line weakens, a leap is taken and a similar plotline is showed with a twist or an extension of incidents before the leap is portrayed, hence stretching the story. 10 unique ways to style a saree Esha Kansaras style diaries From Mogambo to Maharani Bollywood Villains who stunned fans with their wacky costumes From Aishwarya Rai to Katrina Kaif Bollywood Actresses who rocked in bold and unique lipstick shades 10 iconic lines on Mothers from literature From Lag Jaa Gale to Tum Hi Ho Iconic Bollywood Romantic songs that still melt hearts 9 summer flowers for the most beautiful and fresh balcony garden 8 ways to consume sugarcane juice in summer Top 10 must-visit historical landmarks in India",0

I wholeheartedly welcome the India-Pakistan ceasefire announcement. Better late than neverhad it happened two days earlier, we might have avoided the bloodshed and the precious lives lost. But finally, the Director Generals of Military Operations DGMOs from both India and Pakistan spoke over the phone and agreed to re-establish the ceasefire across all sectors, the chief minister told reporters outside his residence, news agency PTI reported.

Better late than neverhad it happened two days earlier, we might have avoided the bloodshed and the precious lives lost. pic.twitter.comhYDPmnn2On  Press Trust of India PTI_News May 10, 2025 Asserting it is now the duty of the Jammu and Kashmir administration to assess the damage in the affected regions, he said, Now, it is the responsibility of the administration to assess the damage caused in affected areas and begin providing relief to the people without delay. He also said he hoped that, with the ceasefire now in place, the Union Government would act swiftly to reopen the airspace and facilitate the resumption of civil aviation. Now that we have a ceasefire I hope the airports can be reopened quickly  civil flights can resume. We have a backlog of hajis who should have been in Medina by now. I hope the Union Government will move quickly to reopen airspace  enable us to resume Haj flights from Srinagar, he wrote in a post on X. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, in a press briefing, announced that both sides will stop all firing and military action from land, air, and sea from 5 pm onwards starting today, adding that the DGMOs will talk again at noon on May 12. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also posted on X that India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action. India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so, he wrote. After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire. Congratulations to both countries on using common sense and great intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter, he wrote. A day after Pakistan launched cross-border drones targeting multiple places in Jammu and Kashmir, apart from other parts of the country, CM Omar Abdullah Friday asked it to focus on de-escalation and said that the continuation of hostilities will only hurt the neighbouring country. The back-to-back cross-border attacks on Thursday night  first around 9 pm and then again at 4.30 am  clearly show an attempt by Pakistan to escalate. However, they will be the ones to suffer the most, Abdullah said. Pakistan gains nothing from this, nor will they succeed. India did not create the crisis, he added. We had to respond as our people were attacked in Pahalgam and innocent civilians were killed. Describing the strikes on Jammu Thursday night as one of the most severe assaults since the 1971 Indo-Pak war, he said The way civilians have been targeted and the kind of attacks carried out in the city, I dont think Jammu has been targeted like this earlier. India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire and to stop all firing and military action from land, air, and sea from 5 pm onwards. The decision was reached after a call between the DGMOs of both countries and discussions with US officials.",1
"Title: Shah Rukh Khans Met Gala look gets an AI makeover by fashion designer fans say Better than what he wore
Description: NIFT Mumbai graduate Utkarsh Upadhyay mixed AI and his own design sensibilities and reimagined SRKs Met Gala outfit.
Content: The Met Gala 2025 turned out to be a landmark moment, especially for Indian fans, as Shah Rukh Khan made his debut at fashions most prestigious night. Sharing the spotlight with fellow Indian stars Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, SRKs appearance was easily one of the most talked-about. Khan walked the red carpet in a striking ensemble designed by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, perfectly tailored to match this years theme Superfine Tailoring Black Style. His outfit featured a black shirt and trousers, cinched at the waist with a soft fabric belt, layered under a sweeping, open-front black jacket. Though his look was largely praised for capturing the essence of the theme, it also drew some mixed opinions online. What couldnt be ignored, however, were the standout accessories multiple layered neck chains with a bold K pendant for King, ornate rings on nearly every finger, and a striking walking stick crowned with a sculpted Royal Bengal tiger head. A post shared by Sabyasachi sabyasachiofficial On May 9, fashion designer and NIFT Mumbai graduate Utkarsh Upadhyay took things to another level. Using a mix of AI and his own design sensibilities, Upadhyay reimagined SRKs Met Gala outfit into five extravagant versions. Describing them as Bombay art deco dandy, Parsi gara elegance, Pashmina royal, Bandhani drape fantasy, and Sabyasachi redux. A post shared by UTKARSH UPADHYAY ikilled_chanel The Internet was hooked. One user said, So much better than what he actually wore. Another commented, They didnt do justice to King Khans personality. It was his aura that saved the look and made it shine otherwise, the outfit was too bland. If someone else had worn it, it wouldnt have worked. Not everyone agreed, though. I feel the dresses are taking away from his face and charm. Too much attention going to the dress in the redesign. Just my opinion. Theyre wonderful designs though, one viewer shared. Meanwhile, someone else applauded the effort behind Upadhyays vision The amount of research, attention to details, and multiple processes for execution gone behind each look. Indian forces strike and destroy nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing five terrorists, including Hafiz Muhammed Jameel and Mohammad Yusuf Azhar, brothers-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar. The strikes targeted the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The terrorists killed were affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish.",1

We had discussions with the district administration and state administration beforehand about the possibility of evacuating fans and how to go about it. But we were all hoping things would get better so that is why we started the game between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals. But there were reports coming in through social media, so we didnt want any situation where fans panicked in the stadium. It was prudent that we stop the game and get fans out of the stadium. As a precaution, we called off the game mid-way because there was so much misinformation flowing. There were 25,000 fans inside the stadium, plus cricketers from two teams and other stakeholders. There was a small break during the game and we had a discussion with the district commissioner, the deputy Commissioner, the senior authorities and people higher up. We spoke about the next step. I went and spoke to people in the team management of both teams and appraised them about the situation. Then I went to the ground and requested all the fans to keep moving. Local administration were getting reports about incidents air raid sirens taking place. There was a sense of insecurity among the players. How did you assure them of their safety? Arun Dhumal We were in regular touch with the team management. Everyone was speaking to their families back home. Even before the game we spoke to them both the teams, and we reassured them that their safety and security is paramount to us. They were ready to play the game. The game happened but with the situation at the border being tense, we thought it would not be appropriate to continue the game in case rumours spread and fans panicked. The next step was to get the players out of Dharamsala. How did you plan that? Arun Dhumal It would have taken a long time for the cricketers to travel by road. So the train was the best and most comfortable option. We also had to look at the best option in terms of the departure station. The players also had a lot of luggage. Thanks to Indian Railways because they sent a special train. Many foreign players have flown back home, what if they dont decide to come back? Arun Dhumal I am sure foreign players would want to come back and be part of the tournament. As the IPL was suspended for one week, everybody wanted to go back to their loved ones. We will review the situation and accordingly keep all the stakeholders informed, including our franchise owners. There are reports that England is open to hosting IPL after border tension? Arun Dhumal Im also hearing this. But we have not had any talks with them. Im glad countries are willing to host this premier tournament.

"Title: Explained How Air Defence Systems work
Description: Key to Indias thwarting of Pakistani aerial attacks along the western border has been the success of Indian air defences.
Content: After thwarting Pakistani attacks on several Indian targets overnight, India on Thursday morning targeted air defence systems in a number of locations in Pakistan. It has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system at Lahore has been neutralised, the Army said in a press release. The Indian response has been in the same domain, and of the same intensity as Pakistan, the release said. Controlling the skies is of paramount importance in modern warfare. As such, air defence systems are a vital cog in any nations defensive infrastructure. A capable and operational air defence system protects against enemy air strikes, as was evident from the fact that Pakistan failed to inflict damage on India during Wednesday-Thursday night. And taking down the enemys air defences leaves it vulnerable to aerial attacks in its territory. The primary objective of an air defence system is to take out threats from the skies  be it enemy fighter aircraft, unmanned drones, or missiles. This is done with the help of a complex system of radar, control centres, defensive fighter aircraft, and ground-based air defence missile, artillery, and electronic warfare systems. An air defence system can be sub-categorised into three interlinked operations. DETECTION Key to the success of any air defence system is its ability to detect threats in the first place. This is typically done by radar, although satellites may be used in certain circumstances  such as an enemy launching an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile ICBM. Radar send out beams of electromagnetic radio waves through a transmitter. These waves are reflected by the objects that they hit  such as an enemy aircraft. A receiver then collects the returning radio waves  based on which it makes inferences such as the distance of the threat, its speed, and its specific nature what kind of aircraft missile. TRACKING The efficiency of an air defence system is also determined by its ability to constantly and accurately track  and not merely detect  an aerial threat. This is typically done using a combination of radar and other sensors such as infrared cameras or laser rangefinders. More often than not, an air defence system is not just dealing with a single threat  it has to identify and track multiple, fast-moving threats in complex and cluttered environments, which may also include friendly aircraft. The accuracy of tracking is crucial for effectively neutralising the enemy without targeting false threats. INTERCEPTION Once the threat has been detected and tracked, it must be neutralised. Here, the specifics of the threat  its range, type what kind of missile aircraft, speed, etc.  determine the ways in which air defences work. All these three aspects of an air defence system have to work together as a cogent whole. This requires what in military parlance is called C3 or a command, control and communication system. Beyond the technical capabilities of detecting, tracking, and intercepting aerial threats, superior communication and decision-making capabilities are crucial for an effective air defence. Depending on the challenges they foresee, nations utilise a wide assortment of weapons to neutralise aerial threats. These include the following. FIGHTER AIRCRAFT Interceptors are fighters that take on attacking enemy aircraft, especially bombers. These agile aircraft can be scrambled at a moments notice, and they climb quickly to altitude and neutralise an enemy aircraft before it deploys its weapons. Interceptors are equipped for air-to-air combat with cannon, rockets, a suite of visual-range and beyond-visual-range missiles, and electronic warfare systems. Aircraft such as the MiG-21  an upgraded variant of which is still in service with the Indian Air Force  were dedicated interceptors latest fighter aircraft have multirole capabilities. India can deploy any of its Sukhoi Su-35s, MiG-29s, HAL Tejas, Mig-21 Bisons, and Dassault Rafales for interceptor missions. SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES SAMS Today, SAMs are the bread-and-butter of most air defence systems. This is because they are more effective than anti-aircraft artillery AAA, and do not put pilots in danger like interceptors. SAMs can be used to target enemy fighters, helicopters, and missiles. They are generally radar-, infrared-, or laser-guided. In addition to being operated from the ground, SAMs can also be launched from ships. The three, oft-used but unofficial classes of SAMs are  Heavy long-range systems which are fixed or semi-mobile  Medium-range vehicle-mounted systems that can fire on the move  Short-range man-portable air-defense systems or MANPADS. Each SAM class has a different function. The heaviest SAMs, such as the Russian-made S-400 system used by India, take on enemy ballistic missiles or aircraft at long range, as much as a few hundred kilometres. Medium range SAMs have the capability to hit targets in the 50-100 km range but are more mobile, and can be launched in next-to-no time. MANPADS are used for low-lying targets such as hovering helicopters or drones, or fixed-wing aircraft engaged in ground attack roles. These are far more cost-effective than the other classes, and have been used extensively not only by militaries but also non-state actors in unconventional warfare. Indias arsenal of SAMs include the indigenously-developed medium-range Akash missiles, the medium-to-long range Barak missiles, and the long-range S-400 missiles. ANTI-AIRCRAFT ARTILLERY AAA Once the cornerstone of ground-based air defence systems, the development of SAMs and capabilities of modern fighter jets have greatly reduced the salience of AAA. But augmented with automated fire-control systems, they remain crucial last-ditch defences, and are also used for specialised anti-unmanned aerial vehicle UAV roles. AAA fire shells rapidly, at rates of over 1,000 rounds per minute. AAA shells are designed to explode at predetermined altitudes so as to disperse shrapnel over a wide area. This makes an AAA battery effective even if it does not achieve a direct hit. ELECTRONIC WARFARE EW It is not necessary to actually shoot down an enemy aerial threat in order to neutralise it. EW systems are designed to disrupt, deceive, or destroy threats using the power of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the context of air defence, EW is most often used to jam enemy radar and targeting systems, so as to impede its ability to accurately and effectively deploy its weapon. EW can confuse attack drones or prevent enemy air-to-surface missiles from homing in on targets. Several highly sophisticated EW systems are in use today. These can operate from both land and air, including from specialised EW aircraft, such as the US Navys Boeing EA-18G Growler, the EW version of the FA-18 Super Hornet. Establishing air superiority allows an Air Force to operate with a degree of impunity, and without fear of attrition in bombing, tactical air support, paratroop insertion, or supply-drop missions. To establish air superiority over enemy territory, the enemys air defence systems have to be neutralised. Suppression of Enemy Air Defences SEAD operations target enemy air defences with missiles, EW, bombs, UAVs or even ground attacks. An analysis published in 2005 found that a quarter of American combat sorties in then recent conflicts had been SEAD missions Christopher Bolkcom, Military Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses SEAD Assessing Future Needs. Given the role of air superiority in providing a protective umbrella for ground forces, taking down enemy air defences also lays the ground for deeper ground attacks into enemy territory. India accuses Pakistan of escalating the situation by attempting air intrusions at over 26 locations and targeting civilian areas and military infrastructure with drones and heavy weapons. India retaliated by engaging with military targets and successfully neutralizing threats, causing minimal collateral damage. Pakistan is moving troops into forward areas, indicating offensive intent.",1
"Title: Family of a helicopter pilot killed in a California wildfire reaches a 15 million settlement
Description: Fournier worked for a private Southern California company that contracts with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, and other agencies to provide firefighting aircraft and other services.
Content: The family of a helicopter pilot who died when his helicopter crashed in 2020 while fighting a wildfire in Southern California reached a 15 million settlement with the company that maintained the aircraft, their attorneys said Friday. Michael Fournier was making water drops on Aug. 19, 2020 over hilly, rugged terrain when his bright red Bell UH-1H copter suddenly plunged into a hillside as he was helping battle the Hills Fire burning 10 miles 16 kilometers south of the small Central Valley town of Coalinga. Fournier worked for a private Southern California company that contracts with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, and other agencies to provide firefighting aircraft and other services. The Fournier familys lawsuit sought answers and accountability, and this result does just that, said Andrew Robb, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit. Robb said the family would not be making any public comments. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Boards concluded that the helicopter crashed because of a hydraulic system failure. Moments before the crash Fournier radioed to air traffic control that he was having trouble with the helicopters hydraulics, Robb said. Fournier was working with Guardian Helicopters, which is based in Fillmore, California and at the time had a contract with Cal Fire to provide emergency services. The settlement was paid by Rotorcraft Support, Inc., the company that maintained the helicopter. A phone message left with the helicopter maintenance company was not immediately returned Friday. Fourniers copter went down in a remote, hilly, smoke-filled area that took a Fresno County Sheriffs Department search and rescue team nearly four hours to reach. Fourteen team members in five Jeeps traveled for miles through soft dirt under smoke-filled skies, finally abandoning the vehicles to walk the last several hundred yards to the crash site. There, they carefully wrapped the body in an American flag and carried it to one of the vehicles. Multiple explosions were heard across the Kashmir Valley on Friday night as suspected Pakistani drones intruded into Indian airspace. This is the first time since the May 7 airstrikes that drones have entered Kashmir. Explosions were heard near Srinagar International Airport, the Armys airfield, and the Awantipora airbase.",1

"Title: Asins husband Rahul Sharma reveals how Micromax went from Rs 12,000 crore to bust in five years Bouncer after bouncer, clean-bowled by full-toss
Description: Former actor Asins husband, entrepreneur Rahul Sharma, explained how his company Micromax went from being one of the biggest mobile phone brands in the world to becoming essentially non-existent only a few years later.
Content: Former actor Asins husband, Rahul Sharma, co-founded one of the biggest players in the mobile phone arena, Micromax. But after a few years during which it dominated the Indian market and took on international brands, it was forced to perform a major pivot. Chinese brands emerged, and the supply chain turned towards them. In several interviews, Rahul has spoken about Micromaxs downfall, which was highly publicised because of how huge the company had become. It was during this period of growth that he married Asin, who backed away from the film industry immediately afterwards. Appearing on Raj Shamanis podcast this year, Rahul said that at its peak, Micromax was among the 10 biggest mobile phone companies in the world. It had successfully fended off competition from the likes of Nokia and Samsung in India, and was delivering a turnover of between Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 15,000 crore. But things began turning around shortly afterwards. Bouncer pe bouncer pad raha tha, uss time full-toss pe bhi bowled ho rahe they, he said. Also read  Asins husband Rahul Sharma recalls Akshay Kumar playing matchmaker for them He said the girl is very simple, down to earth He said, What happened with Micromax didnt happen only with Micromax it was a global phenomenon. There was a lot of brands globally at the time, but people spoke about us because we were the biggest. The supply chain started shifting, and when the supply chain started shifting Rahul said that his companys differentiator was innovation, and they werent allowed to innovate because Chinese manufacturers entered into exclusive deals with emerging Chinese brands. Imagine if today, I want to make a triple-screen phone. I cant, because I dont have the components. Which means I no longer have the edge. We tried for two years, but after a point, we decided that there is no point in burning more money You can keep burning if there is success at the end of the tunnel, but when the opponent has an endless supply of resources, it makes no sense. In an appearance on Nikhil Kamaths podcast, Rahul said that they turned down funding of 800 million from Alibaba in 2014, which, in hindsight, was possibly a mistake. We thought that if wed taken care of the Finnish and the Koreans at that time, we could take care of the Chinese too That was a different game, because when the Chinese came, they came with so much gunpowder, he said. Rahul has now pivoted to the manufacturing business, and is making more money now than he ever did before. Today, our revenue is way bigger than what we used to do in our brand. Most people would probably not know. But we are doing way better than what we used to do earlier, he told Nikhil Kamath.

"Title: Juhi Chawla had a secret wedding with Jay Mehta because she was afraid of losing her career, mother-in-law allowed her to continue working
Description: Juhi Chawla tied the knot with businessman Jay Mehta in the mid-90s, but she wasnt entirely pleased about it in the beginning, because she thought that shed have to give up on her career.
Content: Actor Juhi Chawla tied the knot with businessman Jay Mehta in the mid-90s, but they kept it a secret initially. In an old interview, Juhi explained that this was common in those days, because actors felt that they would be less desirable to the public if they werent single. Juhi had also lost her mother around that time, and was convinced that she would have to stop working if the world came to know that she was married. In an interview with former journalist Rajeev Masand, Juhi recalled how Jay serenaded her, and how supportive her mother-in-law was during that difficult time. Asked why they kept their wedding a secret, she said, Everyone did it those days. You didnt have the internet and you didnt have cameras on every phone, so you could do it that way. Also, I was just about established, and just starting to do well. And thats when Jay was serenading me. I was afraid of losing my career, just when Id got there. I wanted to carry on, and this seemed the midway. Then my mum passed away, and I felt like I was going to lose everything I had. Also read  Asins husband Rahul Sharma is making more money after Micromaxs downfall than he ever did in his life People wouldnt know Recalling their courtship, Juhi continued, We met when I was younger, before I had even started out in the industry. But that was briefly, and with friends. He had another set of friends, but south Mumbai is small. But then, I lost touch with him because I started working, and I was in Andheri, doing my thing. It was at a friends dinner in town that I saw him, and then we got talking again. From then on, everywhere I turned, he turned up. Everywhere I looked, he was there with flowers and notes. Every day. On my birthday, I remember, there was a truckload of red roses. What can you do with a truckload of flowers? But there it was. After a year, he proposed. Juhi said that she was absolutely devastated when her mother died, and was sure that she would have to give up her career after marriage. She added, When a door closes, a window opens. It was Jay, his parents, and his mom especially. There were times when I was really down and out, and she always said to me, Youre like my daughter, dont think of yourself as my daughter-in-law, do what makes you happy. She allowed me to go out and work. Id just got my bearings in the industry and everything was falling apart. At an earlier event, Juhi had said that her wedding invites had to be revoked after she confided in her mother-in-law and told her that she wasnt comfortable with a large wedding. She said at the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce  Industry, I was shooting for some of the really big films of my career and I was supposed to get married. My mother had just passed a year ago. When the marriage date was coming close, I was thinking my mother is gone, whom I loved the most, and now my career will also go away. I didnt know how to be happy about it. So, I broke down one day and I told my mother-in-law and she said, Its okay. She convinced the family to not have the big wedding and I got married at home with just the family and closest friends in attendance. So with just 80-90 people present.

"Title: We need a strategy that makes Pakistan shun proxy wars once and for all
Description: Indias response can build on Pakistans failure  the terror tool doesnt have support, including in JK
Content: Anju Gupta Apart from other measures, a kinetic response to the Pahalgam massacre was inevitable. The sheer brazenness of the terrorists who targeted innocent tourists and attempted to disturb communal peace in India warranted such a response. Indian forces responded on May 7 by targeting nine key sites of three Pakistan and PoK-based terror groups. Since then, the two sides have been locked in aerial aggression, which seems to be escalating. In military terms, the stage has not yet reached the level of a limited war. Pakistans capacity to sustain hostilities is far less than that of India. However, the embattled General Asim Munir could well decide to showcase his countrys nuclear muscle as a desperate act aimed at inviting international intervention to de-escalate. At that stage, Pakistan may try to internationalise the Kashmir issue, equating it with the issue of Palestine. There is no doubt that India has enough resources to thwart any such attempt. That said, it is imperative to appreciate that India and Pakistan have lived with wars since their birth as sovereign nations. This limited near-war is surely going to add to that legacy for generations on both sides. In order to become a developed country, India needs to resolve the Pakistan issue once and for all. The current near-war may be an opportunity to revisit the legacy of past wars while crafting a well-thought-out and patient response to achieve strategic peace with Pakistan. The British colonial power left the Indian Subcontinent divided and Partition uprooted millions on both sides. The stories of violence on both sides can put humanity to shame. Though millions of Muslims remained in their homeland in India, Partition was  and even today is being  described by some Western and South Asian experts as a faith-based division of the Subcontinent. It has distorted public discourse in both countries and created space for hate and intolerance. Another manifestation of the legacy of Partition came quickly with the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India. This, too, was  and is still being seen  by some Western and South Asian experts through a communal lens. The India-Pakistan war in 1947-48 led to another division  this time of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. This Partition was challenged by both sides and a lot has happened since then. This is the second legacy of war between the two sides. It has been used as a basis for destructive interference by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir for decades and as a rationale for the operation of its proxies  terror groups. The third, most defining, legacy of war came in 1971, when, with Indian support, the people of East Pakistan succeeded in their struggle to gain independence from West Pakistan. For Pakistan, the creation of Bangladesh remains an open wound, especially for the Pakistan army, which portrays itself as the eternal saviour of the country. Blaming India for its own failures to handle insurgencies in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa partly stems from this legacy of the 1971 war. The problems between India and Pakistan kept compounding at each stage in their history. Before any reconciliation could happen, another pitch for war would pit one side against the other. The historical baggage kept becoming heavier with each decade. The events in Afghanistan, too, have had a deep impact on India-Pakistan dynamics ever since violent jihad was taught as a tool of resistance to Afghans against the Kabul government, which was supported by godless Soviet troops. Pakistan agreed to become the frontline state to execute this project on behalf of the US, Saudi Arabia and their allies from 1979 to 1989. However, Pakistan has continued to use this tool against neighbours to fulfil its own agenda for the past 36 years. Pakistan has seized on some of its internal divisions and some fissures within India to further its project across its borders. Therefore, when someone refers to terror groups as Islamic terror groups, it suits the Pakistani project and builds its narrative. Fortunately, however, Pakistan has repeatedly failed in creating any mass base for the use of its tool in India, including in Jammu and Kashmir. This must be factored into Indias strategic response. Historically, not many countries have succeeded in carrying out genuine reconciliation after the end of wars or after a long period of active hostilities. Russia and China are two nations that have done so and are reaping benefits today. East and West Germany, too, reconciled with the baggage of a dark past, which they have consciously addressed for the sake of generations to come and the future of Europe. Currently, and understandably, kinetic actions are hogging the mindspace on both sides. The de-escalation will happen eventually, hopefully without any substantive losses to India. India is well-placed to handle that next step. It is also well aware that every terrorist action will need a unique response. That is why there is an urgent need for deep thought on framing a strategic response, one that ensures strategic peace with Pakistan, so that it shuns its proxy wars once and for all. Moreover, Pakistan has already suffered the most significant strategic loss in the current battle by trying to militarily target Jammu and Kashmir, which it claims to support. By harming thriving tourism, Pakistan is now indelibly etched in each Kashmiri mind as the violator of the economic prosperity and advancement of the Kashmiri people.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also posted on X that India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action. India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so, he wrote. After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire. Congratulations to both countries on using common sense and great intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter, he wrote. A day after Pakistan launched cross-border drones targeting multiple places in Jammu and Kashmir, apart from other parts of the country, CM Omar Abdullah Friday asked it to focus on de-escalation and said that the continuation of hostilities will only hurt the neighbouring country. The back-to-back cross-border attacks on Thursday night  first around 9 pm and then again at 4.30 am  clearly show an attempt by Pakistan to escalate. However, they will be the ones to suffer the most, Abdullah said. Pakistan gains nothing from this, nor will they succeed. India did not create the crisis, he added. We had to respond as our people were attacked in Pahalgam and innocent civilians were killed. Describing the strikes on Jammu Thursday night as one of the most severe assaults since the 1971 Indo-Pak war, he said The way civilians have been targeted and the kind of attacks carried out in the city, I dont think Jammu has been targeted like this earlier. India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire and to stop all firing and military action from land, air, and sea from 5 pm onwards. The decision was reached after a call between the DGMOs of both countries and discussions with US officials.",1

The game happened but with the situation at the border being tense, we thought it would not be appropriate to continue the game in case rumours spread and fans panicked. The next step was to get the players out of Dharamsala. How did you plan that? Arun Dhumal It would have taken a long time for the cricketers to travel by road. So the train was the best and most comfortable option. We also had to look at the best option in terms of the departure station. The players also had a lot of luggage. Thanks to Indian Railways because they sent a special train. Many foreign players have flown back home, what if they dont decide to come back? Arun Dhumal I am sure foreign players would want to come back and be part of the tournament. As the IPL was suspended for one week, everybody wanted to go back to their loved ones. We will review the situation and accordingly keep all the stakeholders informed, including our franchise owners. There are reports that England is open to hosting IPL after border tension? Arun Dhumal Im also hearing this. But we have not had any talks with them. Im glad countries are willing to host this premier tournament.

"Title: Explained How Air Defence Systems work
Description: Key to Indias thwarting of Pakistani aerial attacks along the western border has been the success of Indian air defences.
Content: After thwarting Pakistani attacks on several Indian targets overnight, India on Thursday morning targeted air defence systems in a number of locations in Pakistan. It has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system at Lahore has been neutralised, the Army said in a press release. The Indian response has been in the same domain, and of the same intensity as Pakistan, the release said. Controlling the skies is of paramount importance in modern warfare. As such, air defence systems are a vital cog in any nations defensive infrastructure. A capable and operational air defence system protects against enemy air strikes, as was evident from the fact that Pakistan failed to inflict damage on India during Wednesday-Thursday night. And taking down the enemys air defences leaves it vulnerable to aerial attacks in its territory. The primary objective of an air defence system is to take out threats from the skies  be it enemy fighter aircraft, unmanned drones, or missiles. This is done with the help of a complex system of radar, control centres, defensive fighter aircraft, and ground-based air defence missile, artillery, and electronic warfare systems. An air defence system can be sub-categorised into three interlinked operations. DETECTION Key to the success of any air defence system is its ability to detect threats in the first place. This is typically done by radar, although satellites may be used in certain circumstances  such as an enemy launching an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile ICBM. Radar send out beams of electromagnetic radio waves through a transmitter. These waves are reflected by the objects that they hit  such as an enemy aircraft. A receiver then collects the returning radio waves  based on which it makes inferences such as the distance of the threat, its speed, and its specific nature what kind of aircraft missile. TRACKING The efficiency of an air defence system is also determined by its ability to constantly and accurately track  and not merely detect  an aerial threat. This is typically done using a combination of radar and other sensors such as infrared cameras or laser rangefinders. More often than not, an air defence system is not just dealing with a single threat  it has to identify and track multiple, fast-moving threats in complex and cluttered environments, which may also include friendly aircraft. The accuracy of tracking is crucial for effectively neutralising the enemy without targeting false threats. INTERCEPTION Once the threat has been detected and tracked, it must be neutralised. Here, the specifics of the threat  its range, type what kind of missile aircraft, speed, etc.  determine the ways in which air defences work. All these three aspects of an air defence system have to work together as a cogent whole. This requires what in military parlance is called C3 or a command, control and communication system. Beyond the technical capabilities of detecting, tracking, and intercepting aerial threats, superior communication and decision-making capabilities are crucial for an effective air defence. Depending on the challenges they foresee, nations utilise a wide assortment of weapons to neutralise aerial threats. These include the following. FIGHTER AIRCRAFT Interceptors are fighters that take on attacking enemy aircraft, especially bombers. These agile aircraft can be scrambled at a moments notice, and they climb quickly to altitude and neutralise an enemy aircraft before it deploys its weapons. Interceptors are equipped for air-to-air combat with cannon, rockets, a suite of visual-range and beyond-visual-range missiles, and electronic warfare systems. Aircraft such as the MiG-21  an upgraded variant of which is still in service with the Indian Air Force  were dedicated interceptors latest fighter aircraft have multirole capabilities. India can deploy any of its Sukhoi Su-35s, MiG-29s, HAL Tejas, Mig-21 Bisons, and Dassault Rafales for interceptor missions. SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES SAMS Today, SAMs are the bread-and-butter of most air defence systems. This is because they are more effective than anti-aircraft artillery AAA, and do not put pilots in danger like interceptors. SAMs can be used to target enemy fighters, helicopters, and missiles. They are generally radar-, infrared-, or laser-guided. In addition to being operated from the ground, SAMs can also be launched from ships. The three, oft-used but unofficial classes of SAMs are  Heavy long-range systems which are fixed or semi-mobile  Medium-range vehicle-mounted systems that can fire on the move  Short-range man-portable air-defense systems or MANPADS. Each SAM class has a different function. The heaviest SAMs, such as the Russian-made S-400 system used by India, take on enemy ballistic missiles or aircraft at long range, as much as a few hundred kilometres. Medium range SAMs have the capability to hit targets in the 50-100 km range but are more mobile, and can be launched in next-to-no time. MANPADS are used for low-lying targets such as hovering helicopters or drones, or fixed-wing aircraft engaged in ground attack roles. These are far more cost-effective than the other classes, and have been used extensively not only by militaries but also non-state actors in unconventional warfare. Indias arsenal of SAMs include the indigenously-developed medium-range Akash missiles, the medium-to-long range Barak missiles, and the long-range S-400 missiles. ANTI-AIRCRAFT ARTILLERY AAA Once the cornerstone of ground-based air defence systems, the development of SAMs and capabilities of modern fighter jets have greatly reduced the salience of AAA. But augmented with automated fire-control systems, they remain crucial last-ditch defences, and are also used for specialised anti-unmanned aerial vehicle UAV roles. AAA fire shells rapidly, at rates of over 1,000 rounds per minute. AAA shells are designed to explode at predetermined altitudes so as to disperse shrapnel over a wide area. This makes an AAA battery effective even if it does not achieve a direct hit. ELECTRONIC WARFARE EW It is not necessary to actually shoot down an enemy aerial threat in order to neutralise it. EW systems are designed to disrupt, deceive, or destroy threats using the power of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the context of air defence, EW is most often used to jam enemy radar and targeting systems, so as to impede its ability to accurately and effectively deploy its weapon. EW can confuse attack drones or prevent enemy air-to-surface missiles from homing in on targets. Several highly sophisticated EW systems are in use today. These can operate from both land and air, including from specialised EW aircraft, such as the US Navys Boeing EA-18G Growler, the EW version of the FA-18 Super Hornet. Establishing air superiority allows an Air Force to operate with a degree of impunity, and without fear of attrition in bombing, tactical air support, paratroop insertion, or supply-drop missions. To establish air superiority over enemy territory, the enemys air defence systems have to be neutralised. Suppression of Enemy Air Defences SEAD operations target enemy air defences with missiles, EW, bombs, UAVs or even ground attacks. An analysis published in 2005 found that a quarter of American combat sorties in then recent conflicts had been SEAD missions Christopher Bolkcom, Military Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses SEAD Assessing Future Needs. Given the role of air superiority in providing a protective umbrella for ground forces, taking down enemy air defences also lays the ground for deeper ground attacks into enemy territory. The Department of Financial Services has instructed banks to enhance their internal systems to protect against cyber attacks and maintain uninterrupted banking services amidst rising tensions between India and Pakistan. Banks have been advised to ensure adequate cash availability in border areas. Indian armed forces have launched Operation Sindoor to target terror sites in Pakistan.",1
"Title: Texas secures 1.38 billion settlement with Google over data privacy
Description: Google will pay 1.375 billion to settle Texas lawsuits accusing the tech giant of tracking users and collecting biometric data without consent, state Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Friday.
Content: Google has agreed to pay 1.375 billion in a settlement in principle reached with the state of Texas over allegations the company violated users data privacy, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Friday. The agreement settles two lawsuits that covered three products for allegedly violating Texas consumer protection laws. In Texas, Big Tech is not above the law. For years, Google secretly tracked peoples movements, private searches and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won, said Paxton in a statement. Details of the settlement were not disclosed. The Texas attorney general did not say how the money would be used. Google said the agreement settles claims encompassing Incognito, Location History and biometrics-related allegations. The company did not admit any wrongdoing. This settles a raft of old claims, many of which have already been resolved elsewhere, concerning product policies we have long since changed, said a statement from José Castañeda, a Google spokesperson. We are pleased to put them behind us, and we will continue to build robust privacy controls into our services. Paxton sued Google twice in 2022, alleging that it had collected from Texas residents records of their face geometry and voiceprints without obtaining proper consent. He also alleged the company tracked users location even when they thought they had disabled the feature and misled users about Incognito mode, which is meant to provide private browsing. The settlement does not require product changes, according to a Google spokesperson. Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, agreed last year to pay 1.4 billion to settle with Paxton over allegations it unlawfully collected and used facial recognition data. Multiple explosions were heard across the Kashmir Valley on Friday night as suspected Pakistani drones intruded into Indian airspace. This is the first time since the May 7 airstrikes that drones have entered Kashmir. Explosions were heard near Srinagar International Airport, the Armys airfield, and the Awantipora airbase.",1
"Title: Asins husband Rahul Sharma reveals how Micromax went from Rs 12,000 crore to bust in five years Bouncer after bouncer, clean-bowled by full-toss
Description: Former actor Asins husband, entrepreneur Rahul Sharma, explained how his company Micromax went from being one of the biggest mobile phone brands in the world to becoming essentially non-existent only a few years later.
Content: Former actor Asins husband, Rahul Sharma, co-founded one of the biggest players in the mobile phone arena, Micromax. But after a few years during which it dominated the Indian market and took on international brands, it was forced to perform a major pivot. Chinese brands emerged, and the supply chain turned towards them. In several interviews, Rahul has spoken about Micromaxs downfall, which was highly publicised because of how huge the company had become. It was during this period of growth that he married Asin, who backed away from the film industry immediately afterwards. Appearing on Raj Shamanis podcast this year, Rahul said that at its peak, Micromax was among the 10 biggest mobile phone companies in the world. It had successfully fended off competition from the likes of Nokia and Samsung in India, and was delivering a turnover of between Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 15,000 crore. But things began turning around shortly afterwards. Bouncer pe bouncer pad raha tha, uss time full-toss pe bhi bowled ho rahe they, he said. Also read  Asins husband Rahul Sharma recalls Akshay Kumar playing matchmaker for them He said the girl is very simple, down to earth He said, What happened with Micromax didnt happen only with Micromax it was a global phenomenon. There was a lot of brands globally at the time, but people spoke about us because we were the biggest. The supply chain started shifting, and when the supply chain started shifting Rahul said that his companys differentiator was innovation, and they werent allowed to innovate because Chinese manufacturers entered into exclusive deals with emerging Chinese brands. Imagine if today, I want to make a triple-screen phone. I cant, because I dont have the components. Which means I no longer have the edge. We tried for two years, but after a point, we decided that there is no point in burning more money You can keep burning if there is success at the end of the tunnel, but when the opponent has an endless supply of resources, it makes no sense. In an appearance on Nikhil Kamaths podcast, Rahul said that they turned down funding of 800 million from Alibaba in 2014, which, in hindsight, was possibly a mistake. We thought that if wed taken care of the Finnish and the Koreans at that time, we could take care of the Chinese too That was a different game, because when the Chinese came, they came with so much gunpowder, he said. Rahul has now pivoted to the manufacturing business, and is making more money now than he ever did before. Today, our revenue is way bigger than what we used to do in our brand. Most people would probably not know. But we are doing way better than what we used to do earlier, he told Nikhil Kamath.

Next, I played Tá OK by Brazilian singer Kevin O Chris, along with Colombian stars Maluma and Karol G. This fun number transported me straight to the revelry and rhythm of Rio. I also loved the lo-fi, calming work music that gently hummed in my ears, and podcasts felt like I was at the table with the hosts. The device offers great convenience, allowing you to pair with two Bluetooth devices at once. I could easily juggle between my iPhone and MacBook. One tap pauses or plays the music, and taking off the earbuds automatically stops playback thanks to built-in sensors. You can also use head gestures to answer or decline calls by nodding or shaking your head. Voice control is available too. Just say Hi Google or Alexa. The new LinkBuds Fit comes in a compact form factor with a unique, eye-catching design and innovative features tuned for audiophiles.

"Title: We need a strategy that makes Pakistan shun proxy wars once and for all
Description: Indias response can build on Pakistans failure  the terror tool doesnt have support, including in JK
Content: Anju Gupta Apart from other measures, a kinetic response to the Pahalgam massacre was inevitable. The sheer brazenness of the terrorists who targeted innocent tourists and attempted to disturb communal peace in India warranted such a response. Indian forces responded on May 7 by targeting nine key sites of three Pakistan and PoK-based terror groups. Since then, the two sides have been locked in aerial aggression, which seems to be escalating. In military terms, the stage has not yet reached the level of a limited war. Pakistans capacity to sustain hostilities is far less than that of India. However, the embattled General Asim Munir could well decide to showcase his countrys nuclear muscle as a desperate act aimed at inviting international intervention to de-escalate. At that stage, Pakistan may try to internationalise the Kashmir issue, equating it with the issue of Palestine. There is no doubt that India has enough resources to thwart any such attempt. That said, it is imperative to appreciate that India and Pakistan have lived with wars since their birth as sovereign nations. This limited near-war is surely going to add to that legacy for generations on both sides. In order to become a developed country, India needs to resolve the Pakistan issue once and for all. The current near-war may be an opportunity to revisit the legacy of past wars while crafting a well-thought-out and patient response to achieve strategic peace with Pakistan. The British colonial power left the Indian Subcontinent divided and Partition uprooted millions on both sides. The stories of violence on both sides can put humanity to shame. Though millions of Muslims remained in their homeland in India, Partition was  and even today is being  described by some Western and South Asian experts as a faith-based division of the Subcontinent. It has distorted public discourse in both countries and created space for hate and intolerance. Another manifestation of the legacy of Partition came quickly with the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India. This, too, was  and is still being seen  by some Western and South Asian experts through a communal lens. The India-Pakistan war in 1947-48 led to another division  this time of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. This Partition was challenged by both sides and a lot has happened since then. This is the second legacy of war between the two sides. It has been used as a basis for destructive interference by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir for decades and as a rationale for the operation of its proxies  terror groups. The third, most defining, legacy of war came in 1971, when, with Indian support, the people of East Pakistan succeeded in their struggle to gain independence from West Pakistan. For Pakistan, the creation of Bangladesh remains an open wound, especially for the Pakistan army, which portrays itself as the eternal saviour of the country. Blaming India for its own failures to handle insurgencies in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa partly stems from this legacy of the 1971 war. The problems between India and Pakistan kept compounding at each stage in their history. Before any reconciliation could happen, another pitch for war would pit one side against the other. The historical baggage kept becoming heavier with each decade. The events in Afghanistan, too, have had a deep impact on India-Pakistan dynamics ever since violent jihad was taught as a tool of resistance to Afghans against the Kabul government, which was supported by godless Soviet troops. Pakistan agreed to become the frontline state to execute this project on behalf of the US, Saudi Arabia and their allies from 1979 to 1989. However, Pakistan has continued to use this tool against neighbours to fulfil its own agenda for the past 36 years. Pakistan has seized on some of its internal divisions and some fissures within India to further its project across its borders. Therefore, when someone refers to terror groups as Islamic terror groups, it suits the Pakistani project and builds its narrative. Fortunately, however, Pakistan has repeatedly failed in creating any mass base for the use of its tool in India, including in Jammu and Kashmir. This must be factored into Indias strategic response. Historically, not many countries have succeeded in carrying out genuine reconciliation after the end of wars or after a long period of active hostilities. Russia and China are two nations that have done so and are reaping benefits today. East and West Germany, too, reconciled with the baggage of a dark past, which they have consciously addressed for the sake of generations to come and the future of Europe. Currently, and understandably, kinetic actions are hogging the mindspace on both sides. The de-escalation will happen eventually, hopefully without any substantive losses to India. India is well-placed to handle that next step. It is also well aware that every terrorist action will need a unique response. That is why there is an urgent need for deep thought on framing a strategic response, one that ensures strategic peace with Pakistan, so that it shuns its proxy wars once and for all. Moreover, Pakistan has already suffered the most significant strategic loss in the current battle by trying to militarily target Jammu and Kashmir, which it claims to support. By harming thriving tourism, Pakistan is now indelibly etched in each Kashmiri mind as the violator of the economic prosperity and advancement of the Kashmiri people.

"Title: Juhi Chawla had a secret wedding with Jay Mehta because she was afraid of losing her career, mother-in-law allowed her to continue working
Description: Juhi Chawla tied the knot with businessman Jay Mehta in the mid-90s, but she wasnt entirely pleased about it in the beginning, because she thought that shed have to give up on her career.
Content: Actor Juhi Chawla tied the knot with businessman Jay Mehta in the mid-90s, but they kept it a secret initially. In an old interview, Juhi explained that this was common in those days, because actors felt that they would be less desirable to the public if they werent single. Juhi had also lost her mother around that time, and was convinced that she would have to stop working if the world came to know that she was married. In an interview with former journalist Rajeev Masand, Juhi recalled how Jay serenaded her, and how supportive her mother-in-law was during that difficult time. Asked why they kept their wedding a secret, she said, Everyone did it those days. You didnt have the internet and you didnt have cameras on every phone, so you could do it that way. Also, I was just about established, and just starting to do well. And thats when Jay was serenading me. I was afraid of losing my career, just when Id got there. I wanted to carry on, and this seemed the midway. Then my mum passed away, and I felt like I was going to lose everything I had. Also read  Asins husband Rahul Sharma is making more money after Micromaxs downfall than he ever did in his life People wouldnt know Recalling their courtship, Juhi continued, We met when I was younger, before I had even started out in the industry. But that was briefly, and with friends. He had another set of friends, but south Mumbai is small. But then, I lost touch with him because I started working, and I was in Andheri, doing my thing. It was at a friends dinner in town that I saw him, and then we got talking again. From then on, everywhere I turned, he turned up. Everywhere I looked, he was there with flowers and notes. Every day. On my birthday, I remember, there was a truckload of red roses. What can you do with a truckload of flowers? But there it was. After a year, he proposed. Juhi said that she was absolutely devastated when her mother died, and was sure that she would have to give up her career after marriage. She added, When a door closes, a window opens. It was Jay, his parents, and his mom especially. There were times when I was really down and out, and she always said to me, Youre like my daughter, dont think of yourself as my daughter-in-law, do what makes you happy. She allowed me to go out and work. Id just got my bearings in the industry and everything was falling apart. At an earlier event, Juhi had said that her wedding invites had to be revoked after she confided in her mother-in-law and told her that she wasnt comfortable with a large wedding. She said at the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce  Industry, I was shooting for some of the really big films of my career and I was supposed to get married. My mother had just passed a year ago. When the marriage date was coming close, I was thinking my mother is gone, whom I loved the most, and now my career will also go away. I didnt know how to be happy about it. So, I broke down one day and I told my mother-in-law and she said, Its okay. She convinced the family to not have the big wedding and I got married at home with just the family and closest friends in attendance. So with just 80-90 people present.

"Title: Nvidia modifies H20 chip for China to overcome US export controls Report
Description: Nvidia plans to release a modified version of its H20 AI chip in China as early as July, in response to tightened US export restrictions.
Content: Nvidia plans to release a downgraded version of its H20 artificial intelligence chip for China in the next two months, following U.S. export restrictions on the original model, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The US chipmaker has notified major Chinese customers, including leading cloud computing providers, that it aims to release the modified H20 chip in July, two of the sources said. The downgraded H20 represents Nvidias latest attempt to maintain its presence in one of its most crucial markets in the face of Washingtons expanding efforts to restrict Chinas access to advanced semiconductor technology. The H20, which had been Nvidias most powerful AI chip cleared for Chinese sales, was effectively blocked from the market after US officials informed the company last month that the product would require an export license. Nvidia has formulated new technical thresholds, which will guide the development of the modified chip designs. These specifications will result in significant downgrades from the original H20, including substantially reduced memory capacity, one of the sources said. Another of the sources said downstream customers could potentially modify the module configuration to adjust the chips performance levels. Nvidia declined to comment. The US Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China accounted for 17 billion in revenue, or 13 of Nvidias total sales, in the fiscal year ended January 26. Highlighting the countrys strategic importance, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited Beijing last month, just days after US officials announced the new export license requirements for the H20 chip. During meetings with Chinese officials, Huang emphasised Chinas significance as a key market for the company. The US has restricted exports of Nvidias most sophisticated chips to China since 2022, citing concerns about their potential military applications. The H20 was introduced after Washington tightened export controls in October 2023. Chinese technology giants including Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance, TikToks parent company, stepped up H20 chip orders amid growing demand for cost-effective AI models from companies such as startup DeepSeek, Reuters reported early this year. Nvidia had accumulated 18 billion worth of H20 orders since January, according to a Reuters report last month.

Description: Bank quick response teams are working 24x7 in shifts, with a top-level executive available throughout the day. They are regularly ensuring that banks branches are functioning properly and all ATMs have sufficient cash.
Content: Amid escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, the Department of Financial Services DFS has asked banks to strengthen their internal systems to deal with any cybersecurity threats and ensure uninterrupted banking services. Banks have been asked to ensure sufficient availability of cash in their branches and ATMs, especially in the areas that are closer to the border. On Wednesday, the Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor to strike various terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, to avenge the Pahalgam terror attack. On Thursday evening, Indias air defence systems intercepted missiles and projectiles fired by Pakistan toward key border areas. A week back, we reviewed our position, as advised by the Department of Financial Services DFS. We have strengthened our system. A quick response team QRT, consisting of all the general managers of IT and operations and deputy general managers, has been established. One of the executive directors and I are also part of the team, Canara Bank Managing Director and CEO, K Satyanarayana Raju, told The Indian Express. He said the QRT is working 247 in shifts, with a top-level executive available throughout the day. They are regularly ensuring that banks branches are functioning properly and all ATMs have sufficient cash. We are very much alert. A meeting is happening every day to review the situation. The QRT is keeping a close watch on any cybersecurity threat or any unwanted activities in our system, he said. Another state-run lender Union Bank of India said it has formed a proactive multi-layered defence strategy and it is continuously monitoring all the strategies. Digital is a very important portfolio for us, and we are taking all measures. In view of the things that are happening around us, we are taking all precautions with regard to the digital initiatives and cyber security areas, said Union Bank of Indias Managing Director and CEO A Manimekhalai. Besides, banks are also ensuring adequate availability of cash at branches and ATMs to meet the likely increase in the demand for cash amid the prevailing uncertainty. We are closely monitoring the cash position in our ATMs as we dont want to disturb our banking services, especially in border-level villages. We have been ensuring this since the last one week, Canara Banks MD  CEO Raju said. Manimekhalai said the DFS has told the bank to maintain sufficient cash in ATMs and branches. The economy has to keep going, and customer service also needs to be taken care, she said. She said the bank operates a state-of-the-art cyber security centre of excellence in Hyderabad and a 247 cyber security operation centre to enable real-time oversight and response to any kind of threats in the digital channels. The lender is also conducting a comprehensive awareness program to educate both staff and customers to ensure cyber preparedness and resilience at every level.

READ MORE The Pakistan Cricket Board on Friday postponed the Pakistan Super League PSL, hours after announcing that the T20 tournament has been shifted to the UAE because of the ongoing military conflict with India. The decision to postpone has been taken pursuant to advice received from the Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif who has kept in view the reckless aggression from India that has escalated to a point where national attention and sentiments are rightly focused on the courageous efforts of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who are vociferously upholding the sovereignty of our beloved Pakistan, PCB said in a statement said The PCB and its players stand resolutely in solidarity with the families of the martyrs and our security personnel defending the nation, the statement added further.

PTI With England Cricket Board hosting the previous two World Test Championship Final and the upcoming WTC final between Australia and South Africa later in June this year, the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI had expressed interest in making a bid for hosting the WTC final in 2027. According to a report by The Guardian, the Indian board wants to stage the WTC final after the WTC cycle and had submitted the intention for the bid for the 2027 final at the meeting of the ICC Chief Executives Committee in Zimbabwe last month. With 58 matches played and 12 more to go, it would be interesting to see how the BCCI takes it forward. One way is to take stock of the situation after a week and start the tournament 10 days later by having double headers. If that isnt a possibility then the BCCI would have to wait to search for a window as the international calendar is packed in the coming months. After the PBKS vs DC game was abandoned, fans, players and officials were evacuated out of the HPCA Stadium. The evacuation of players from the HPCA stadium was done so quickly that many of the players reached the hotel with their pads still on, write Devendra Pandey and Venkata Krishna B in their report for The Indian Express.

Initially, the organisers and BCCI said that there had been a significant technical failure at the HPCA Stadium. After a prolonged delay, the announcement was made the game was being called off! As The Indian Express Devendra Pandey and Venkat Krishna B mentioned in their report The players from both teams were asked to board their buses and head to the team hotel. The evacuation was so swift that many of the players reached the hotel with their pads still on. Eventually, after a meeting on Friday, the BCCI made the decision to suspend the IPL 2025 season at least by a week. In 2009, the entire tournament was moved to South Africa because of security issues amid the Lok Sabha elections. In 2020, the tournament was played in the UAE in September, instead of the usual April-May window, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next year, the event began in India in a bio-bubble but was halted when players began testing positive for the deadly infection. The league was eventually completed in the UAE in September that year. Update Tonights match at BRSABV Ekana Cricket Stadium has been cancelled.

"Title: Using AI at work? Colleagues may think you are lazy and less intelligent, says new study
Description: A new study suggests that people who use AI for work as often perceived as lazy, incompetent and less inteliigent compared to those who dont.
Content: A new study suggests that people who use AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot at work are perceived as less intelligent and lazy by their co-workers. While several reports, including Googles very own, suggest that AI can boost productivity in certain scenarios, it looks like the use of these tools have a hidden social cost. Funded by Duke University and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study focuses on how AI use is viewed by the people in the workforce. Researchers said they conducted four online experiments on 4,400 people. In this, participants were to imagine scenarios where some workers used AI tools while others did not, and asked them how they viewed themselves and others in such circumstances. The first experiment involved asking people to imagine using an AI app to complete work projects and asking them how they thought others would perceive them if they used such tools. As it turns out, many participants involved said that they would be termed as less diligent, lazy and incompetent while some said that they would be looked at as easily replaceable compared to those who didnt use such apps. The next experiment asked participants to describe colleagues who used AI apps to complete their work. Unsurprisingly, the researchers found out that such employees were termed as incompetent, less independent and less self-assured. In the third experiment, people were to assume the role of managers looking to hire new employees. The researchers said if managers found out that the candidate admitted to use AI to work had less chances of being hired compared to those who dont. However, if the manager used AI at work, the chances of hiring a candidate who used AI tools for work were similar to those who did not use them. As for the last experiment, researchers asked people that if an AI tool was appropriate for the task and has had a positive effect on efficiency, the negative perceptions were negligent for the most part. In short, the study suggests that the use of AI tools in workplaces may be limited because of how the technology is perceived by others and that we still have a long way to go before AI becomes mainstream in offices.",1
"Title: China this week  China on Operation Sindoor, tariff talks with US, and ties with Russia
Description: Every Friday, we recap highlights of the weeks news from China. This week, China again referred to its all-weather friendship with Pakistan, announced tariff negotiations with the US, and talked up ties with Moscow. Here are 3 key developments.
Content: On May 7, the spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry described Indias strikes on terrorist training camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as regrettable, but said China was ready to work with the international community and continue to play a constructive role in easing the current tensions.  After the prolonged confusion that we detailed in our tracker last week, there was a breakthrough on the United States-China standoff on tariffs. On May 6, it was announced that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would hold talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland from May 9 to 12. I think were going to have a good weekend with China, US President Donald Trump said.  On May 9, Chinese President Xi Jinping was in Moscow for Russias Victory Day parade, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The Chinese spokesperson said, India and Pakistan areboth Chinas neighbours and China opposes all forms of terrorism. We urge both sides to act in the larger interest of peace and stability, remain calm, exercise restraint and refrain from taking actions that may further complicate the situation. After the terrorist attack on innocent civilians in Pahalgam on April 22, China had offered condolences to the victims, and expressed sincere sympathy to the bereaved families and the injured. After the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to his Pakistani counterpart Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times said on April 27, China is closely following the evolving situation of the tensions between Pakistan and India following the terrorist attack in the Kashmir region, supporting the prompt initiation of an impartial investigation, hoping both sides will exercise restraint, move toward each other, and work to de-escalate tensions. Wang described terrorism as a shared responsibility of all nations, and said China consistently supports Pakistans firm counter-terrorism actions, the report said. He underlined Chinas steadfast support for Pakistan As an ironclad friend and all-weather strategic cooperative partner, China fully understands Pakistans legitimate security concerns and supports its efforts to uphold its sovereignty and security interests. On May 8, a Global Times report quoted Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, as saying that clashes and friction between India and Pakistan are expected to persist, and given that both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers, prolonged conflict carries enormous risks. UPSHOT Chinas reactions have been in line with its past statements. It has spoken of condemning terrorism but not named Pakistan for its well-documented state support for terrorism and terrorist groups. Pakistan is dependent on IMF bailouts and Chinese loans for its survival. Beijing has repeatedly thwarted attempts by the United States and India in the United Nations to blacklist Pakistani terrorists such as Sajid Mir, one of the chief planners of the 2611 Mumbai terror attacks. US equity-index futures rose and the dollar strengthened on news of the US-China trade talks, Bloomberg reported. US tariffs on Chinese goods are currently at 145, and Chinas tariffs on American goods at 125, making trade virtually impossible. Bessent, 63, told Fox News, Weve got to de-escalate before we move forward, presumably towards a trade deal. The US, he said, wanted fair trade with China. Bessent is a key figure in the Trump administration who has argued for lowering the April tariffs on US trade partners. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, 70, has engaged with Western business leaders and former US Fed chief Janet Yellen in recent months. Chinas Ministry of Commerce said, Any dialogue and negotiation must be carried out on the premise of mutual respect, equal consultation, and mutual benefit. As an old Chinese saying goes, listen to what someone says and watch what they do. The statement warned that if the US says one thing but does another, or even attempts to use negotiations as a pretext to continue coercive and blackmailing tactics, China will never agree, nor will it sacrifice its principles or international fairness and justice to seek any agreement. UPSHOT A climbdown on tariffs is expected, although there may be no drastic reductions in the short run. Trump has cited wide-ranging issues in trading with China for years, and their resolution may take time. That said, the contraction reported in the US economy in the first quarter and the concerns over weak domestic consumption in China will nudge both parties towards seeking some relief. A recent Reuters report referred to concern in the Chinese government about the impact of the US tariffs, and the risk of isolation as Chinas trading partners negotiated deals with Washington. In a signed article in Russian media ahead of his visit to Moscow, President Xi Jinping emphasised the historical roots and strength of China-Russia ties, saying they fought shoulder to shoulder against German Nazism and Japanese militarism. He also attempted to draw comparisons to the present Eighty years later today, however, unilateralism, hegemonism, bullying, and coercive practices are severely undermining our world. Some of these adjectives, such as unilateralism and hegemonism, have frequently been used in Chinese statements to refer to the US. On Taiwan, Xi wrote Taiwans restoration to China is a victorious outcome of WWII and an integral part of the postwar international order No matter how the situation on the Taiwan island evolves or what troubles external forces may make, the historical trend toward Chinas ultimate and inevitable reunification is unstoppable. UPSHOT China and Russia have deepened their ties following Russias invasion of Ukraine. Russias isolation by the West was offset by China. From a few years before 2022 to the present, Russia-China trade has been rising year-on-year. Rishika Singh is a Senior sub-editor at the Explained Desk of The Indian Express.

Yadav also issued an order on Friday, directing that all shopping malls, cinemas, restaurants, clubs and shops except medical stores shall remain closed from 7 pm on May 9 till 6 am on May 10. Following the order, a complete shutdown of shops was seen in Chandigarh from 7 pm. Mohali District Magistrate Komal Mittal also on Friday imposed night restrictions with the closure of cinema halls and shopping malls in the district from 8 pm to 6 am with immediate effect. Panchkula Deputy Commissioner Monika Gupta also appealed to market associations to switch off display board lights and ensure no external or internal lights remain on in commercial establishments on Friday night. Shopkeepers have been requested to observe a voluntary blackout and close markets by 7 pm Friday. CCTV cameras, if present, should be turned off to enhance the effectiveness of the blackout, Gupta said, adding that lights in common parking areas should also be turned off. Gupta also directed that no lights should remain on at night in government headquarters and offices. Relevant department heads must ensure compliance, she said. To ensure the timely dissemination of any alerts, monitoring teams have been formed for different areas. These teams will use sirens and loudspeakers to notify people in the event of a sudden alert, the official said. Ban on firecrackers Authorities in Chandigarh and Mohali have also imposed a ban on the bursting of firecrackers. Invoking Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, the Chandigarh DM order prohibited the use of firecrackers during weddings, festivals, and other celebrations due to the potential threat of misuse by anti-social elements and the panic such noise could cause among the public. The ban will be in effect from May 9 to July 7, 2025. Violations will invite legal action under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023. The order has been issued in public interest and will be widely publicised through official and media channels, read the order. A complete ban has also been imposed in Mohali on the use of firecrackers, high-beam laser lights, and DJ systems during the evening hours, to facilitate blackout operations whenever necessary without any hindrance from outdoor lighting. Furthermore, the administration has prohibited the use of inverters, generators, and any other backup power sources used for billboards, outdoor lighting, and street lights. Even solar-powered lights are banned during blackout periods in the district until further notice. Ambala District Magistrate Ajay Singh Tomer also banned the use of inverters or generators for outdoor lighting. However, these may be used for indoor use on condition that all doors and windows are fully covered by thick curtains so as to ensure no lights come out, the order said. The Panchkula administration has imposed a complete ban on the use of firecrackers and loudspeakers during public or private functions, including weddings and celebrations. Any such use must be backed by prior official permission. These restrictions have been imposed with immediate effect and will remain in force until further notice. Violations will be dealt with strictly under Section 223 of the Indian Penal Code, 2023, stated an official of the Panchkula administration. The police in Panchkula have mobilised all four companies comprising over 400 personnel. Emergency Response Vehicles, PCRs, and rider teams are fully deployed, and police checkpoints are operating at maximum alert levels, officials said. A blanket ban has been imposed on drone operations within the district. Blackouts The Tricity region witnessed blackouts from the evening on Friday, with the traffic lights and street light blinkers also remaining off. The Panchkula Deputy Commissioner assured residents that the city is completely safe and there is no need for a curfew as she appealed to residents to stay vigilant and cooperate with safety protocols. She also advised residents to avoid panic and trust only official communications from the district administration. Gupta added that only information from the administrations social media handles or the official civil society WhatsApp groups, which include ward councillors, sarpanches, and other key community leaders, should be trusted. Earlier, chairing a meeting with officials at the district secretariat, Gupta mentioned that following a sudden blackout alert, a district-wide blackout was observed on Thursday night. She noted that another alert could be issued on Friday as well. As a precautionary measure, she urged all residents to voluntarily observe a blackout on Friday evening and remain indoors. All lights inside homes should be turned off, Gupta said, adding that people should avoid going out unless there was an urgent need. Meanwhile, Chandigarh DC also said that emergency announcements, including blackout alerts, may be issued on very short notice  ranging from five to ten minutes. Citizens are, therefore, requested to remain alert and act promptly upon receiving such communications, he added. Authorities in Haryanas Ambala on Friday also ordered a complete blackout from 8 pm till 6 am. Chandigarh Airport closed till May 15 At least 24 airports in northern and western parts of the country, including Srinagar and Chandigarh, have been shut for civilian flights till May 15, sources said on Friday. Leaves cancelled, exams postponed The Chandigarh Administration has instructed all employees of its departments, boards, and corporations to remain stationed within city limits until further notice. According to an official statement issued on Friday by the Department of Public Relations, all government personnel are required to maintain their respective headquarters or stations in Chandigarh. The administration has strictly prohibited employees from leaving their designated stations. Additionally, all previously sanctioned leave stands cancelled with immediate effect, unless it is reapproved by the concerned Secretary under exceptional circumstances. The Chief Engineer of the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh has also issued a directive mandating the immediate cancellation of all employees leave and the implementation of a round-the-clock, seven-day work schedule. The official notice emphasises the need for uninterrupted municipal operations and states that all previously sanctioned leave stands cancelled with immediate effect. No new leave applications will be entertained until further notice, the order stated. According to the communication, this measure has been taken to ensure the continuity of essential civic services during this critical period. All municipal employees are required to adhere strictly to the revised schedule. Meanwhile, the Panjab University PU has decided to postpone the PU-CET U.G. entrance test 2025, which is scheduled for May 11. A new date will be updated later. Keeping in view the situation prevailing in Punjab, the offices, institutionsregional centrerural centreconstituent colleges of PU will remain closed from May 9 to May 11. However, administrative offices and teaching departmentsinstitutionscentres on PU campuses in Chandigarh and the affiliated colleges situated here will function as usual. Strawberry Fields High School, Sector 26, Chandigarh, in compliance with the directive from the Chandigarh Administration, cancelled the Class XII International Baccalaureate IB Diploma Programme IB DP English Paper 2 examination on Thursday, due to the lack of a safer alternative venue. The National Lok Adalat, which was scheduled to be held in Chandigarh on Saturday, has also been postponed. With inputs from Parul, Jasbir Malhi, and PTI India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire and to stop all firing and military action from land, air, and sea from 5 pm onwards.

"Title: Don 3 teaser Ranveer Singhs first look revealed, says 11 mulkon ki police dhoondti hai mujhe
Description: Ranveer Singh, hot off the success of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, will take over from Shah Rukh Khan in Farhan Akhtars upcoming Don 3. Watch the first teaser here.
Content: After weeks of speculation, Ranveer Singh has finally been announced as the star of the upcoming Don 3. He takes over from Shah Rukh Khan, who played the titular role in two Don movies, released in 2006 and 2011, respectively. The character was originally played by Amitabh Bachchan in the 1978 hit Don. Excel Entertainment made the announcement via a video shared online. The video opens with a man sitting on the floor of a large room overlooking the neon-lit skyline of an unnamed city. The skyline itself appears to be a composite of multiple cities. The character slowly rises to his feet, takes off his hood, and lights a cigarette. The whole time, he is narrating an ominous voiceover in Hindi. Sher jo so raha hai woh jaagega kab? Poochte hain yeh sab. Unse keh do ki phir jaag utha hoon main, aur phir saamne jald aane ko When will the sleeping lion wake up? Everybody wants to know. Tell them, I am here. He continues, Kya hai taakat meri, kya hai himmat meri, phir dikhane ko. Maut se khelna zindagi hai meri, jeetna hi mera kaam hai Im back to show you what Im made of, before concluding with the iconic line of dialogue made famous first by Amitabh and then by Shah Rukh Tum toh hai jaante jo mera naam hai. 11 mulkon ki police dhoondti hai mujhe, par pakad paaya hai mujhko kaun? Main hoon Don. Don 3 was first planned with Shah Rukh returning, but the film never took off despite sustained fan interest for years. Slated for a 2025 release, Don 3 will be directed by Farhan Akhtar, who also helmed the two SRK movies. It remains unclear if this impacts the production schedule of the already announced Jee Le Zaraa, starring Alia Bhatt, Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif. Don 3 is the first film that Ranveer has announced following the success of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, which came after a string of flops. He is also rumoured to be attached to the upcoming reboot of Shaktimaan. Click here to follow Screen Digital on YouTube and stay updated with the latest from the world of cinema.

"Title: On NCP SP uniting with NCP Sule says will talk to party leaders, workers before deciding
Description: I will have to talk to party workers and leaders before taking any decision in this regard, Sule told reporters.
Content: A day after NCP SP national president Sharad Pawar said his daughter Supriya Sule would take a decision on the party joining hands with Ajit Pawars NCP, the Baramati MP on Friday said she would talk to party leaders and workers before taking the call. I will have to talk to party workers and leaders before taking any decision in this regard, Sule told reporters. On Thursday, Sharad Pawar said, Leaders of both NCP factions follow one ideology. In our party, some leaders believe if development works in their constituencies are to be implemented, then they should join hands with Ajit Pawars party. However, there are some who believe we should not join hands. Our leaders are divided in two parties, but we continue to follow the same ideology. In an interview to The Indian Express earlier this week, Sharad Pawar had first spoken about the possibility of the two factions uniting. As far as we are concerned, there are two views inside the party. One is that we reunite with the NCP led by Ajit Pawar. The second section feels do not go directly or indirectly with the BJP. Lets join the INDIA group and reorganise the alliance. Sharad Pawar said any decision whether they should join hands with Ajit Pawars party would be taken by the new generation in the party. Our MP Supriya Sule will take the decision in this regard Im now out of the decision-making process, he said. The undivided NCP split in June 2023 when Ajit Pawar walked away with 40 MLAs. However, of late there have been speculations about the two parties coming together as both the Pawars have met three-four times in the last two months. Sule said right now the priority for her was to ensure that citizens who are outside the country are brought back home safely. The country comes first, state and politics later, she said. At this point, Sule said her party and the MVA were backing the government and the armed forces to the hilt.

May 10, 2025e-Paper Published - May 10, 2025 0658 pm IST Dr. Preetha Reddy, Executive Vice Chairperson, Apollo Hospitals, Dr. Chandrakant Lahariya, Medical Doctor, Writer, and Health and Social Sector Policy Adviser, Dr. Anoop Misra, Chairman, Fortis CDOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences, moderated by Ramya Kannan, Chief of Bureau, Tamil Nadu, The Hindu, on the second day of The Hindu Huddle 2025, in Bengaluru on May 10, 2025.  Photo Credit K. Murali Kumar The explosive popularity of GLP-1 Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 drugs for addressing weight loss, diabetes and obesity, such as Ozempic and Munjaro are useful for a limited number of people and will not solve the obesity or diabetes crisis that India is battling, said Dr Anoop Misra, Chairman, Fortis Centre of Diabetes, at The Huddle by The Hindu on Saturday. These drugs werent new drugs, he explained and had been around for nearly two decades. However earlier versions of these drugs had limited weight-loss benefits. Some of these drugs were effective at aiding weight-loss upto 20 but were still only suitable for a limted segment of people who were terribly obese and resistant to diet and exercise-based regimen, cautioned Dr Misra, an acclaimed diabetologist with decades of research experience under his belt. At the panel convened to discuss the challenges from non-communicable diseases in India, labelled as the Trojan Horse of India healthcare, the discussants  Dr Preetha Reddy, Executive Vice Chairperson, Apollo Hospitals Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, Health and Social Sector Policy Adviser and Dr Misra  agreed that sedentary lifestyles, excessive consumption of high-fat and sweetened foods were they causes of this Trojan Horse incursion. The prevalence of obesity was rising among youngsters and there was concern that were these trends to continue, the much-vaunted demographic dividend, or the surplus of youth, who would power Indias economic future, would become a liability, said Dr Reddy. We want to keep people out of hospital beds, she underlined. Governments and public health bodies could play a role in discouraging the two whites- salt and sugar  whose excessive consumption was a problem but Dr Lahariya cautioned that sugar was a source of inexpensive calories for a vast number of Indias poor who often could not meet their daily caloric needs. Salt, he informed, was an integral part of the staple Indian diet and Indians on average consume twice the World Heath Organisation recommendations. That said, he suggested, imposing heavy taxes may not be advisable and instead there ought be better more visible warnings on detrimental health effects in packaged food. Advising against mindlessly following health fads, Dr. Misra said that ketogenic diets low carbohydrate-high fat diets ought not to be followed beyond three months. It was instead healthier to tweak regular diets to cut calories and increase protein content, he opined. So called gluten-free diets that cost thrice as much had no benefit. Id always recommend low-cost diets, Dr Misra advised. There is well-founded research that cutting 15kgs can in several cases reverse diabetes. While the challenges from diabetes were significant, Dr Lahariya said that India was also grappling a mental health crisis. The prevalence of some form of mental health challenge was around 12 nearly almost as diabetes, and severe mental illness around 2. It is high time that public health institutions evolved a systematic response. he added. While India was a developing country, it had managed to evolve a system of health screening that was comparable to developed countries. It can certainly be improved and there is a range of options available that are a 10th of what it costs in the West, reckoned Dr Reddy.

"Title: Does the planet K2-18b show signs of life?  Explained
Description: K2-18b, a potentially habitable exoplanet 124 lightyears away, may contain biomarker DMS, but its habitability remains uncertain.

April 20, 2025e-Paper Updated - April 20, 2025 0948 am IST An artists conception of what exoplanet K2-18 b might look like based on James Webb Space Telescope data and scientific models.  Photo Credit REUTERS The story so far On April 17, an international research team published a paper in which it reported that the distant exoplanet K2-18b may be habitable. The claim was met with cautious excitement by astronomers. While finding places in the universe that could harbour life is a vital quest, experts  including the team that made the finding  are cautious because many similar claims in the past have had to be retracted after closer inspection. K2-18b is an exoplanet  a planet outside the solar system. Its located 124 lightyears away from the earth in the constellation Leo, orbiting the star K2-18. It is 5.2-times wider and roughly nine-times more massive than the earth, dimensions that suggest it likely possesses a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. The amount of stellar radiation it receives from its star is comparable to what the earth receives from the sun. It was discovered by the Kepler telescope in 2015. In 2019, the Hubble Space Telescope found that its atmosphere contains signs of water vapour. Four years later, the James Webb Space Telescope JWST also detected signs of carbon dioxide and methane. Scientists had previously shown in modelling studies that its possible to find methane and carbon dioxide and no ammonia in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere if but not only if there is a liquid water ocean on a planets surface. According to the new work, K2-18b might be a Hycean world covered with an ocean overlaid by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. The JWST is designed to study such planets better than other telescopes can, although K2-18b itself isnt confirmed to be Hycean. Some computer models suggest it may also have a stratosphere and some carbon oxides and cyanide in the middle atmosphere. Researchers have also said its surface conditions may be close to the runaway greenhouse threshold  when the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevents any heat from escaping the surface. This is why Venus is a hellscape. Also read How scientists are exploring what extraterrestrial life could look like In the new paper, the team reported the presence of two compounds  either dimethyl sulphide DMS or dimethyl disulphide DMDS  in K2-18bs atmosphere. Scientists have previously suggested that DMS could be a biomarker, a sign of life, on exoplanets. This is because, on the earth, DMS is made mostly in the oceans. Phytoplankton produce a molecule called dimethylsulphoniopropionate. When they die, enzymes break up the molecule to release DMS. Its also emitted when bacteria break up plant matter. In 2015, researchers reported that 76 of soil bacteria contain a gene that allows them to produce DMS. Volcanic eruptions also release trace amounts of DMS. Experts have said the only way to find extraterrestrial life is for them to directly detect it. This is why NASA launched its Clipper mission in 2024 to study Jupiters moon Europa, including tracking signs of life in its vapour plumes. Attempts to look for conditions suitable for life that too only life as we know it and the presence of specific molecules from a distance can only be suggestive of habitable conditions, not confirmatory. Many uncertainties in these studies arise from astronomers instruments and the accuracy of models they use to simulate conditions in outer space. Hitherto unknown non-biological processes may be capable of creating the molecules scientists consider to be biomarkers. For example, in 2024, researchers from Europe and the US reported that the comet 67PChuryumov-Gerasimenko contained DMS of abiotic origin. They wrote in their paper Future studies need to investigate whether or not the present inference of cometary DMS could provide an abiotic source of DMS in a planetary atmosphere. JWST not being able to detect certain compounds could mean theyre present at concentrations below its detection threshold. In 2023, the team studying K2-18b had reported detecting a hint of DMS on the planet. Now it has said the compound may actually be present in 1,000-times greater quantities than on the earth. Since DMS is shortlived, something on the surface could be constantly producing it. However, the paper only reported a significant detection of DMS or DMDS, not just DMS. This is because both DMS and DMDS have a very similar chemical signal. The researchers couldnt tease it apart to confirm the presence or absence of DMS alone. Scientists have also been modelling the physical conditions on K2-18b to check for alternative explanations for its chemistry. One study in 2023 said most of the current Hycean world observational targets are not likely to sustain a liquid water ocean. In 2024, a U.S. team published a paper saying the JWST observations can be explained by K2-18b being a gas-rich mini-Neptune that does not need a biosphere or other unknown source of methane to explain the data. In January this year, an international team reported that a comprehensive reanalysis of K2-18b data collected by JWST confirmed the presence of methane but yielded no statistically significant or reliable evidence for carbon dioxide or DMS. This conclusion doubted whether K2-18b was a Hycean world. Several false alarms  including the TRAPPIST-1 system, the exoplanet WASP-12b, and even Venus  have taught scientists to triple-check such claims before accepting them.

May 10, 2025e-Paper Published - May 10, 2025 0308 pm IST - New Delhi Photo dbrs.morningstar.com Morningstar DBRS, a global ratings agency, has upgraded its rating of Indias long-term and short-term debt on the basis of the countrys structural reform efforts, fiscal consolidation, resilient banking system, and high potential growth rate. Indias long-term rating was raised to BBB from BBB low, while short-term rating was raised to R-2 high from R-2 middle. The successful implementation of reforms coupled with infrastructure investment and rapid digitalization have helped drive Indias recovery in the post-pandemic period, with GDP expanding on average by 8.2 from FY22 April 2021 to March 22 to FY25, Morningstar DBRS said in its ratings rationale document. Fiscal consolidation remains on track with improvements in transparency of government accounts and the quality of spending. The ratings agency also noted that inflation has returned to the Reserve Bank of Indias comfort band, and that the external sector is strong. While the imposition of U.S. tariffs adds uncertainty to the outlook, India looks comparatively well-positioned, given the low level of goods exports to the U.S. and the domestic-driven nature of the Indian economy, the agency added. However, it also raised a few concerns regarding Indias high deficits and debt levels. Despite recent improvements, Indias perennially large fiscal deficits and elevated government debt levels characterise the countrys credit profile, the agency noted. On a general government basis, the public debt-to-GDP ratio has moderated since the shock of the pandemic but remains high at 80.2 in FY25. Morningstar DBRS added that it could further upgrade Indias credit ratings if it does a combination of things continues implementing reforms that raise the countrys investment rate and materially reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio.

"Title: Sam Altman Extends Olive Branch To Elon Musk After Old Posts Surface Lets Be Friends
Description: Sam Altman has expressed a willingness to work with Elon Musk despite the duo being involved in a feud for some time.
Content: Sam Altman has extended an olive branch to Elon Musk after the Tesla boss quoted a few old posts where the OpenAI CEO was critical of US President Donald Trump. Mr Altman signalled a willingness to work with Mr Musk, saying human-level artificial intelligence AI, popularly referred to as Artificial General Intelligence AGI, was much more important than their feud. On Saturday May 10, Mr Musk reacted to a post from almost a decade ago where Mr Altman claimed that he would never vote for Donald Trump. Mr Musk quoted a post from Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham, which read, Few have done more than Sam Altman to defeat Trump. Mr Altman responded, Thank you, Paul. After Mr Musk reshared the interaction, Mr Altman posted an article where the former had said I dont hate the man Donald Trump, but its time for Trump to hang up his hat  sail into the sunset. We were both wrong, or at least I certainly was, but that was from 2016 and this was from 2022, Mr Altman replied to the article link. Anyway, see you next week, lets be friends. agi too important to let a lil feud get in the way, he added in the same thread. anyway, see you next week, lets be friendsagi too important to let a lil feud get in the way Watch Swami Yos War Prophecy On BeerBiceps Show Amid India-Pak Conflict Goes Viral Mr Musk, who is a close ally of President Trump, has been running the Department of Government Efficiency DOGE to cut flab. His campaigning for the Republican leader during the presidential race was pivotal in turning the tide. Meanwhile, Mr Altman was also displayed a notable change in political stance by contributing to the 500 billion Project Stargate for building AI infrastructure in the US. Mr Musk has been critical of the direction OpenAI is taking under Mr Altman. While Openai was founded as a non-profit with the X boss as one of the co-founders in 2015, Mr Altman sought to turn the company into a for-profit venture. After months of uncertainty, OpenAI earlier this week announced that the non-profit would continue to retain control of the company. What is AGI? AGI takes AI a step further. While AI is task-specific, AGI aims to possess intelligence that can be applied across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. In essence, AGI would be a machine with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in diverse domains, much like a human being.

Content: The Army shared video footage of the precision strikes conducted on Friday. The Indian Army has destroyed multiple terrorist launchpads located near the Line of Control LoC in Jammu and Kashmir. The targeted strikes came in response to a wave of drone attacks and cross-border escalations initiated by Pakistan in recent days, the Ministry of Defence confirmed on Saturday. The Army shared video footage of the precision strikes conducted on Friday. The targeted sites had long been under surveillance for their role in enabling infiltration and planning terror attacks against civilians and security forces in India. The Indian Armys swift and decisive action has dealt a significant blow to terrorist infrastructure and capabilities, the Army said in a statement. READ  India-Pakistan Tensions Follow Live Updates Here The military response follows a series of attempted drone strikes by Pakistan across cities in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. According to sources, the drones, identified as Turkish-origin Byker YIHA III kamikaze drones, were launched with high-explosive payloads aimed at inflicting civilian casualties in densely populated urban zones, including Amritsar.

"Title: Osama Bin Laden, Nukes, Djinns Pak Army Spokespersons Family Ties
Description: Theres one common denominator that brings terrorist Osama Bin Laden, nuclear weapons and djinns to the same room -- Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Director General of Pakistans Inter-Services Public Relations ISPR.
Content: Lt General Chaudhry is the son of Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood. Theres one common denominator that brings terrorist Osama Bin Laden, nuclear weapons and djinns to the same room -- Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Director General of Pakistans Inter-Services Public Relations ISPR. Tensions between India and Pakistan have been escalating in recent weeks, forcing Lt General Chaudhry to make more media appearances than he is used to. That has put the spotlight on his family. Lt General Chaudhry is the son of Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a nuclear engineer once honoured by the Pakistani state, and later sanctioned by the United Nations for his alleged contacts with terrorist organisations, including al-Qaeda. Read  India-Pakistan Tensions Follow Live Updates During his decades-long tenure with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission PAEC, Mahmood played a key role in the development of Pakistans nuclear infrastructure, contributing to the construction of uranium enrichment plants and the design of reactors necessary for Pakistans transition from uranium to plutonium-based weapons capability. These facilities form the backbone of Pakistans nuclear arsenal. But it is Mahmoods post-retirement affiliations and ideological inclinations that have raised the most concerns among Western intelligence agencies. READ  JF-17, Mirage, Drones Indias Plan Behind Choosing Pak Air Force Targets In the early 2000s, Mahmood co-founded Ummah Tameer-e-Nau UTN, which claimed to be an NGO operating in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. UTNs activities included building schools and infrastructure in Kandahar. US and Pakistani intelligence later discovered that the organisation served as a cover for deeper engagements with terror networks. According to the United Nations, Mahmood and his colleague Chaudhri Abdul Majeed met Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in August 2001, weeks before the 911 attacks. While no conclusive evidence emerged to suggest that nuclear weapons technology had been transferred, the meetings triggered alarm in Washington and led to Mahmoods arrest and interrogation by Pakistani authorities. READ  Swift, Calibrated Response Indian Fighter Jets Bomb Pak Air Force Bases UTN provided Usama bin Laden and the Taliban with information about chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. During UTN visits to Afghanistan, Bashir-Ud-Din met Bin Laden and Al-Qaida leaders and discussed nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. During 2001, Bashir-Ud-Din also met Mullah Omar, listed as Mohammed Omar Ghulam Nabi. During a follow-up meeting, an associate of Usama bin Laden indicated that he had nuclear material and wanted to know how to use it to make a weapon. Bashir-Ud-Din provided information about the infrastructure needed for a nuclear weapons program and the effects of nuclear weapons, the United Nations statement read. The ISI eventually released Mahmood, claiming that he lacked the technical know-how to independently assemble a nuclear weapon. Born in Pakistan and educated in the United Kingdom, Mahmood was conferred the Sitara-e-Imtiaz, Pakistans third-highest civilian honour, by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Ironically, Mahmood later became a vocal critic of Sharif. READ  Operation Sindoor Eliminated These 5 Terrorists How Pakistan Gave Them Funeral Mahmoods scientific writings also feature djinns, the mythical beings that feature prominently in Islamic literature. According to Mahmood, these beings are key to solving earths energy crisis. His son, Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, emerged professionally through a separate channel, the Pakistan Army. Trained as an officer in the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, Chaudhry has held various postings, including within the military operations directorate and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation DESTO, an institution involved in Pakistans defence research. DESTO had been subjected to US sanctions following Pakistans nuclear tests in 1998, though these were eased after 911 to facilitate cooperation in the War on Terror. READ  India Confirms Bases Attacked By Pakistan, Debunks Claims Of Heavy Damage According to the book The Man from Pakistan by investigative journalists Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins, Mahmood viewed Pakistans nuclear arsenal not as an asset but as the collective property of the Muslim community. He believed that nuclear weapons should be shared with other Islamic countries, particularly those confronting the West. The book describes a 2001 meeting in Kandahar during which Mahmood and Majeed offered technical guidance to al-Qaeda operatives.

"Title: Cinnamon May Reduce Effectiveness Of Some Prescription Drugs Study
Description: Patients are advised to consult their physician before consuming supplements containing cinnamon or similar products.
Content: Cinnamon, when consumed in large dosages, particularly as nutritional supplements, may reduce the efficacy of several prescription medications, according to a new study. The study, published in the June edition of the Food Chemistry Molecular Sciences journal, looked at how cinnamon and its primary ingredients affected the bodys capacity to metabolise drugs, The Washington Post reported.It noted concerns regarding cinnamons potential interactions with medicines and the shortage of scientific data on the spices effects on human metabolism.While minimal intake may have health benefits, extended use may increase the risk of drug interactions, the study said, without specifying how much was excessive.According to researchers, overconsumption of cinnamon may cause the body to quickly flush out prescription drugs, affecting a persons capacity to absorb them.Lead researcher Bill Gurley, chief scientist at the University of Mississippis National Centre for Natural Products Research, told The Post, We know theres a possibility for cinnamaldehyde to activate these receptors that can pose a risk for drug interactions.The researchers studied cinnamon oil and two of its chemical constituents, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, simulating human digestion to ascertain whether and how cinnamon influences drug metabolism.They found that both cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid have the ability to trigger the bodys xenobiotic receptors. These sensors aid in regulating how drugs are processed by the body.According to CNN wellness expert Dr Leana Wen, supplementing with cinnamon may help manage diabetes or aid in weight loss, per some studies, but further research is required to explore its potential advantages fully.Cassia cinnamon may contain high concentrations of the blood thinner coumarin, and traces of coumarin may also be present in Ceylon cinnamon.Thus, an individual taking anticoagulant drugs may be at higher risk of bleeding if they consume a lot of coumarin, said Mr Wen.How much is too much was not specified in the Food Chemistry study, but researchers cautioned that concentrated forms, such as supplements, are more dangerous.Patients are advised to consult their physician before consuming supplements containing cinnamon or similar products.

"Title: ECB Makes Huge Offer To BCCI After IPL 2025 Postponement Report  Cricket News
Description: The BCCI has postponed IPL 2025 for one week following Indias escalated tensions with Pakistan.
Content: The England and Wales Cricket Board ECB has reportedly offered to host the remainder of Indian Premier League IPL 2025. Notably, the season has been suspended for a week as the tensions between India and Pakistan escalate. The contest between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals on Thursday, that happened to be the 58th match of IPL 2025, was called off midway due to security reasons and the crowd at the venue was evacuated. The following day saw the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI postponing IPL 2025. The tournament has 16 more matches to be played, including the playoffs. As uncertainity looms over the future of IPL 2025, The Guardian has reported that ECB chief executive Richard Gould has already contacted his equivalents at the BCCI regarding the proposal of ECB hosting the remainder of the season. Should India be unable to restart the IPL after this week-long hiatus, one suggestion is for England to host the remaining fixtures later in the year, the report said. A senior ECB source has confirmed this could be possible in September, albeit adding that no active discussions are currently taking place, it added. The report further said that a similar offer was made by the ECB when IPL 2021 was postponed due to the threat of COVID-19. At that time, the tournament was suspended following multiple bio-bubble breaches and rising COVID cases among players and staff in India. However, the season was resumed and completed in the United Arab Emirates around four months later. Less than a day after deciding to relocate the Pakistan Super League to Dubai in the wake of the conflict with India, the Pakistan Cricket Board PCB has made a U-turn and decided to postpone the 10th edition of the franchise-based T20 league for an indefinite period. The Pakistan Cricket Board PCB announces the postponement of the remaining eight matches of the HBL PSL X, said PCB in a statement on Friday. The PCB made the announcement in a press release on its official website and said it has taken the decision because of increased aerial attacks by India and following advice received from the Pakistan Prime Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif. The last 24 hours have seen a worsening of the situation on the LOC, increased incursion of 78 drones, and the firing of surface-to-surface missiles from India. The decision to postpone has been taken pursuant to advice received from the Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif who has kept in view the reckless aggression from India that has escalated to a point where national attention and sentiments are rightly focused on the courageous efforts of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who are vociferously upholding the sovereignty of our beloved Pakistan, the PCB said in its statement. It is altogether another matter that India has only responded to the terrorist attack on innocents in Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives, and also targeted terrorist and military installations across the border.

Pakistans air defence system in Lahore and several of its posts along the Line of Control and International Border were destroyed in Indian artillery response. India has countered all of Pakistans misinformation and disinformation campaigns with time-stamped photographic and video evidence, while also releasing footage of the destruction of Pakistani posts, terror camps, and other military infrastructure. While the ceasefire puts the military operations on hold, Indias punishing diplomatic actions on Pakistan remain. Indian military spokespersons also addressed the media, in which they countered Pakistans fake news and fake narratives, and issued a caution to Pakistan that India remains fully prepared and ever-vigilant, and committed to defending the sovereignty and integrity of the motherland. Every misadventure by Pakistan has been met with strength, and every future escalation will invite a decisive response. India remains fully operationally-ready to launch whatever operations are required in defence of the nation.

"Title: Why UN Rejected US-Israeli Proposal To Initially Feed Only 60 Of Gaza
Description: An American-Israeli proposal to take over the distribution of food and other supplies in parts of Gaza has been rejected by the United Nations and other aid groups.
Content: An American-Israeli proposal to take over the distribution of food and other supplies in parts of Gaza has been rejected by the United Nations and other aid groups. Outlining the plan to funnel humanitarian aid into the war-torn region, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would initially feed 60 per cent of the total population in the war-torn strip, CNN reported. The idea behind the latest move was to distribute food and other supplies such that Hamas militants dont get their hands on it, Mr Huckabee said. This comes as Hamas has time and again been accused of stealing aid shipments to the region by the Israeli side, despite multiple humanitarian aid groups claiming that civilians continue to have access to the overwhelming majority of food aid, the report added. The Associated Press reported that the new aid distribution system was planned to take over the ongoing one, managed by the United Nations and other aid agencies. Under the new plan, distribution sites will be guarded by private military contractors from the United States and run by aid workers. On the involvement of the Israeli military, Mr Huckabee said they will provide necessary military security outside the area of these distribution sites. Initially, they will establish four of these distribution sites. As per the foundation document, pre-packaged rations, hygiene kits, and medical supplies will be provided through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to 1.2 million people or nearly 60 population in Gaza. To a query about the remaining 40 population, Mr Huckabee noted that this will get scaled up in the coming time. Speaking at the US Embassy in Jerusalem on Friday, Mr Huckabee said the US-backed mechanism should take effect soon. This comes ahead of US President Donald Trumps scheduled visit to the Middle East, Reuters reported. Hamas responds In a statement on Friday, Hamas said the latest US-Israeli proposal was part of Jerusalems plan for displacement and subjugation through a policy of starvation. The group urged the international community to prevent militarisation of humanitarian aid and take urgent action. It claimed that this could transform into a tool for managing starvation and termed it a blatant violation of humanitarian standards. UN rejects US-Israeli plan The United Nations, along with other aid groups in the region, rejected the plan. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, in a document, said the US-Israeli mechanism appears practically unfeasible, incompatible with humanitarian principles and will create serious insecurity risks, all while failing to meet Israels obligations under international law, according to CNN. Further, the world body slammed the proposal over the minimal number of distribution sites in Gaza. It mentioned that around 400 of these used to operate in the region before the total blockage by the Israeli side. Under the new plan, Palestinians might have to walk longer distances to carry ration packages to their families. The UN agencies have urged Israel to lift the 10-week siege on Gaza. The proposal has been rejected by Israel. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world",0

"Title: Soviet-Era Spacecraft To Reenter Earth After 53 Years In Orbit Report
Description: A former Soviet spacecraft is predicted to crash back to Earth this week.
Content: A former Soviet spacecraft is predicted to crash back to Earth this week. Weighing approximately 453 kg, Kosmos 482 will reenter the planets atmosphere around May 10, CNN reported. Launched in 1972, Kosmos 482 malfunctioned on its way to Venus. An issue with a timer resulted in an early engine shutdown, trapping the Soviet spacecraft in Earths orbit for over half a century. With the aircraft now set to crash down, scientists are unsure which part of it will reenter the Earth. Some think it will be the probe, also known as the entry capsule. The majority of space debris and meteors, which frequently veer toward a crash-landing on Earth, break apart due to friction and pressure as they strike the planets dense atmosphere while travelling thousands of miles per hour. Cosmos 482, being a Soviet reentry capsule, is expected to be equipped with a substantial heat shield. It was designed to survive the extreme temperature and pressure of landing on Venus. The spacecraft might well survive Earth atmosphere entry and hit the ground, wrote Dr. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, on his website. He added, The risk of the object hitting people on the ground is likely minimal, and theres no need for major concern, but you wouldnt want it bashing you on the head. According to scientists, Cosmos 482 may land within 52 degrees north or south of the equator. Even if the area contains a large portion of the ocean, entire countries are still vulnerable to an uncontrolled spacecraft crashing down on their territory. Since a lot of the Earth is covered by oceans, scientists are optimistic that it will land in water. However, no one is certain about it. If Cosmos 482 hits dry land, its important that onlookers avoid touching the debris. Dangerous fuel leaks or other damage to humans and property might occur from the outdated spaceship.

"Title: Man Complains Of Stomach Pain For Years, Doctors Find This Inside His Body
Description: Doctors at a hospital in Punjabs Moga were in for a shock on Thursday when, while operating on a patient, they discovered earphones, lockets, screw and even rakhis inside his stomach. The 40-year old was admitted to the Medicity Hospital in Moga.
Content: Doctors at a hospital in Punjabs Moga were in for a shock on Thursday when, while operating on a patient, they discovered earphones, lockets, screw and even rakhis inside his stomach. The 40-year old was admitted to the Medicity Hospital in Moga with high fever and stomach ache after he complained of nausea for over two days. As his stomach pain failed to subside, doctors decided to conduct an X-ray scan on his stomach to determine the cause of his pain. The results were disturbing. The scan showed several metallic objects lodged inside the mans stomach. After a three-hour long surgery, doctors were able to successfully remove the items from his body. Among the almost hundred items pulled out of his stomach were earphones, washers, nuts and bolts, wires, rakhis, lockets, buttons, wrappers, hairclips, a zipper tag, a marble and a safety pin. Dr. Ajmer Kalra, the director of the hospital, said this was the first such case encountered by him and the man had been suffering from stomach problems for two years. Even though all the items were removed from his body, the mans condition is not stable, the doctor said. The items were inside his stomach for a long time and that has caused other health issues, he added. The mans family said they were also surprised by the findings and did not know when and why he consumed the items. His parents had no clue about how he managed to eat the items but said that he suffered from mental illnesses. They said he complained of stomach ache and was unable to sleep, days before he was hospitalised. They had taken him to several doctors before but none were able to diagnose the cause behind his pain. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world",0
"Title: Deadly Fungus Could Kill Millions In Asia, Europe And The Americas, Study Warns
Description: The study warned that the world was approaching a tipping point where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm.
Content: A killer fungus could spread through parts of Europe, Asia and the Americas, causing serious lung problems for vulnerable people due to rising temperatures, a new study has warned. Aspergillus, a type of fungus that thrives in warm, damp climates, has the potential to infect millions if it makes its way into the aforementioned regions. Norman van Rhijn, the study co-author, has warned that the world was approaching a tipping point where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm. Were talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions. In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different, Mr Van Rhijn told the Financial Times. As per the study, the species can grow quickly in high temperatures in compost, which explains why it is able to thrive in the 37C internal temperature of the human body. Additionally, fungis resilience means they can survive and thrive in places that other organisms cant, even inside Chernobyls nuclear reactors. While inhaling the funguss spores does not make everyone ill, those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or a weakened immune system remain at risk. Also Read  Fake Mount Fuji In China With White-Paint Hilltop Scams Tourists What makes the situation worrisome is the fact that the fungal kingdom is largely unexplored by scientists. Less than 10 per cent of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million fungi species have been described, and only a tiny fraction have had their genetic material genome sequenced. Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs, said Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University. The study highlighted that Aspergillus fumigatus could spread across an additional 77 per cent of territory by the year 2100 as a result of the worlds heavy use of fossil fuels. As a result, potentially nine million people in Europe could be exposed to the infection. While the danger is imminent, scientists say the development of antifungal medicines has been hobbled by the financial unattractiveness of investing in them, because of high costs and doubts over their profitability.

"Title: Mexico just hit cruise passengers with a new visitor fee And its not optional
Description: Cruise-ship passengers who arrive in any Mexican port will now have to pay a visitor fee. This will be applicable from July 1.
Content: Subscribe Now! Get features like In a recent development, passengers who arrive by cruise ships to any port in Mexico will have to pay up a 5 visitor fee. This rule will be applicable from July 1, as announced by the Mexican government and the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association. Both entities arrived at this compromise to derive a tariff from visitors to these ports. Just six months ago, the Mexican government demanded that this tariff per passenger should be 42, but after long talks with the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association FCCA, the amount of 5 was fixed for now. This was mainly after complaints from cruise operators and the FCCA themselves. The fee was then negotiated on the basis of these complaints, citing the protection of cruise ship tourism. ALSO READ  After Ras Barakas arrest, 2 other Democrats spotted breaching Delaney Hall ICE center However, according to Border Report, this amount will increase up to 21 in the next three years. Moreover, this fee will be directly added to the cruise package, and no separate payments have to be made by passengers to the Mexican government. The tour operators will be taking care of the same from their end. The Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association thanked Mexicos federal government in a statement, saying, We are grateful to Mexicos federal government for collaborating with us to reach an agreement on the transit fee that protects cruise ship tourism, increasing benefits to local communities whose livelihood depends on it. As per FCCA data, more than 3,000 cruise ships will land up at Mexican ports over the year and will be bringing in nearly 10 million passengers. This would mean that Mexicos federal government will be earning more than 50 million in transit fee from cruise ship passengers within the year. Once this tariff increases, so will the governments earnings from it.",0

Content: Subscribe Now! Get features like The Kosmos 482 spacecraft, a Soviet spacecraft that was launched in 1972 on an unsuccessful trip to Venus, fell back into Earth on Saturday morning. The Soviet Unions 482 millimeter Kosmos satellite is said to have fallen 560 kilometers west of Middle Andaman Island, Indian Ocean, west of Jakarta, Roscosmos said Earlier, the European Space Agency, which was keeping an eye on the crafts uncontrollably falling trajectory, informed that radar last detected it above Germany. Radars stopped monitoring the Kosmos 482 at the time of its anticipated crash, indicating that it is most likely that the reentry has already occurred, NBC News reported. There are no reports of damage or injuries so far. The Kosmos 482 spacecraft was a component of the Venera program, a set of probes designed to study the planet Venus for the USSR. Of those flights, ten made a successful landing on the scorching, desolate planet, while Kosmos 482s rocket failed. The lower stage, which held the descent ship, became trapped in Earths orbit. The 1,069-pound, about three-foot-wide spacecraft ringed the Earth in an ever narrower elliptical orbit over the next fifty-three years, eventually approaching the planet and plummeting into its atmosphere. Kosmos 482 Soviet spacecraft Are there any impact of space debris?Space debris falling back to Earth is not uncommon. According to ESA, over 2,400 man-made items plummeted from orbit in 2022, setting a new record. While a few of them crashed into an ocean, the bulk of them burned up in Earths atmosphere. However, Kosmos 482 was designed to function on Venuss surface, where the average temperature is 867 degrees Fahrenheit 464 C, and to survive a descent through the planets thick atmosphere. This implied that it was sufficiently resilient in principle to withstand a relatively simple re-entry via the atmosphere of Earth. There is no record of any individual being killed by space debris. In a blog post on Kosmos-482, ESA officials stated that The risk of any satellite reentry causing injury is extremely remote. The annual risk of an individual human being injured by space debris is under 1 in 100 billion. In comparison, a person is about 65,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning. The US Space Force predicted Friday that the spacecraft would return to the atmosphere on Saturday morning around 152 a.m. ET over the Pacific Ocean, west of Guam.

Lt Gen Chaudhry, a three-star general, has been actively briefing the press in his capacity as the chief of the Inter-Services Public Relations since India conducted intelligence-based strikes at nine terror camps, including the headquarters of the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, to avenge the fatal attack on 26 people, mainly tourists, in Pahalgam on April 22. As per the United Nations documents, Chaudhrys father, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, born in Amritsar, was known to have met the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Mahmood is alleged to have provided insights into the infrastructure necessary for a nuclear weapons programme as well as the effects associated with nuclear weapons. In addition, he was accused of raising funds for a fundamentalist organisation, Ummah Tameer-e-Nau, founded in 1999 to support humanitarian causes in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan before the US invasion in 2001. Mahmood, who retired from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, has authored several books discussing the intersection of religion and science, including Mechanics of the Doomsday and Life after Death, in which he reflects on the ultimate fate of the universe from an Islamic perspective. Currently 85 years old, Mahmood lives in Islamabad. Lt Gen Chaudhry was appointed as the Director General of the ISPR by Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir in December 2022. Notably, he was the first officer from the Pakistan Armys Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering to achieve this position. He previously held significant roles, including serving as the director general of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation , a clandestine military research entity, besides working in military operations. The Ummah Tameer-e-Nau, which was banned and sanctioned by the US in 2001, had ties to several notable figures in Pakistan, including the controversial former director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence , Lt Gen Hamid Gul. Mahmood was arrested in 2001 after he reportedly admitted to meeting Osama bin Laden, but was later released when authorities concluded that he lacked the technical knowledge to transfer nuclear secrets. His name also figures in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list of the US Treasury department.

Senior General. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmars military government, stated at a forum in Naypyitaw that 2,719 deaths have been confirmed, along with 4,521 injuries and 441 people still missing, according to Western News online. With rescue operations still ongoing and many affected areas yet to be reached, the numbers are expected to rise further. It seems like earthquakes have become more frequent lately, causing massive destruction and tragic loss of life. Does this indicate that an even more powerful earthquake could strike soon, potentially leading to catastrophic devastation on a global scale? The United States Geological Survey USGS explains that short-term fluctuations in seismic activity are a normal part of the natural variation in earthquake rates. An increase or decrease in global seismicity does not necessarily indicate that a large earthquake is about to occur, the agency says. The ComCat earthquake catalogue has shown a rise in recorded earthquakes in recent years, but this is not due to a higher number of earthquakesits because there are now more seismic instruments in place, allowing for the detection and recording of more earthquakes. The British Geological Survey suggests several reasons why it may appear that we are encountering more earthquakes. The National Earthquake Information Center now tracks around 20,000 earthquakes annually, averaging about 55 per day. According to USGS data, due to advancements in communication and growing interest in natural disasters, the public is now informed about earthquakes faster than ever. Long-term data since 1900 indicates that, on average, there are 16 major earthquakes each year, including 15 magnitude 7 quakes and 1 magnitude 8 or greater. Over the past 40-50 years, weve exceeded this average about a dozen times. The highest total occurred in 2010, with 23 major quakes. However, in some years, the total was significantly lower, such as in 1989 6 major quakes and 1988 7 major quakes, both well below the long-term average of 16. March 30, 2025  Tonga Earthquake M7.0 The earthquake west of the Tonga Trench resulted from reverse faulting, with rupture occurring on either a steeply dipping reverse fault or a shallowly dipping thrust fault. Given the depth and location, the shallowly dipping thrust fault at the plate interface is the more likely source. This event was primarily caused by subduction zone activity in the region. March 28, 2025  Myanmar Earthquake M7.7 This earthquake occurred due to strike-slip faulting along the India-Eurasia plate boundary. The rupture likely took place on the right-lateral Sagaing Fault, a major tectonic feature in the region. The finite fault solution indicates motion along a north-striking right-lateral fault, confirming its association with the ongoing tectonic activity between the Indian and Sunda plates. February 8, 2025  Cayman Islands Earthquake M7.6 This event was triggered by strike-slip faulting near the North AmericaCaribbean plate boundary. The rupture occurred along a steeply dipping structure, with possible right-lateral or left-lateral motion. The tectonic movement between the North America and Caribbean plates at a rate of approximately 20 mm per year was the primary driver of this earthquake. January 7, 2025  Tibetan Plateau Earthquake M7.1 The earthquake in the southern Tibetan Plateau was caused by normal faulting at shallow depths within the Eurasian plate, north of the Himalayan mountain boundary. The fault responsible was oriented perpendicular to the plate boundary, indicating crustal extension in the region. This type of faulting is typical for intra-plate earthquakes in areas experiencing tectonic stress adjustments. 2010 Haiti Earthquake The Port-au-Prince metropolitan area was devastated, with an estimated 300,000 deaths and 1.5 million people left homeless. The earthquake caused widespread destruction and a humanitarian crisis. 2008 Sichuan Earthquake The earthquake killed nearly 90,000 people, injured 375,000, and left over 5 million homeless. More than half of Beichuan town was destroyed due to the seismic impact and water release from a nearby lake. 2005 Kashmir Earthquake A magnitude-7.6 quake struck Pakistan-administered Kashmir and NWFP, also affecting India and Afghanistan. At least 79,000 people died, and 32,000 buildings collapsed. It was among the most destructive earthquakes of modern times. 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake  Tsunami A magnitude-9.1 undersea earthquake struck off Sumatra on December 26, 2004. The tsunami waves, some reaching 30 feet 9 meters high, spread across 13 countries, killing at least 230,000 people. Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives, and Thailand suffered the worst damage. 1976 Tangshan Earthquake China On July 28, 1976, a magnitude-7.5 earthquake nearly wiped out the coal-mining city of Tangshan. The official death toll was 242,000, but estimates suggest up to 655,000 deaths. At least 700,000 were injured, and destruction extended as far as Beijing. 1970 Great Peruvian Earthquake On May 31, 1970, a massive earthquake off western Peru triggered landslides, collapsing many poorly built structures. Around 70,000 people died, and significant infrastructure damage resulted.",0

Get features like Betsy Arakawa, the wife of actor Gene Hackman and an American classical pianist, died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare virus transmitted by mice, according to autopsy results released on Friday in New Mexico. The 64-year-old Arakawa, along with the 95-year-old Oscar-winning actor and one of their dogs, were found dead on February 26 in different rooms of their Santa Fe home, according to Reuters. At a press conference held by the Santa Fe Sheriffs Office, officials confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease, while Arakawas death was attributed to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Reuters quotes authorities as saying that Arakawa had passed away a week before Hackman. When asked whether Gene Hackmans advanced Alzheimers prevented him from realising his wifes death, Sheriff Adan Mendoza responded, I would assume that is the case. Heather Jarrell, chief medical investigator at the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, added, He was in an advanced state of Alzheimers, and it is quite possible he was not aware she was deceased. Also Read Based on her last email, officials believe Arakawa died around February 11. Hackmans date of death was determined to be February 18, based on his pacemaker activity, authorities said. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome HPS is a severe and potentially fatal lung disease. Symptoms appear 1 to 8 weeks after exposure. Early signs include fatigue, fever, and muscle aches especially in the thighs, hips, back, and shoulders. About half of the patients also experience headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. After 4 to 10 days, late symptoms develop, including coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness due to fluid buildup in the lungs. According to the CDC, the disease can be deadly, with a 38 fatality rate among those with respiratory symptoms.",0

"Title: Air India buys six Boeing 777s after over seven years Report
Description: The airlines move comes against the backdrop of supply chain constraints delaying deliveries as well as refurbishment works of its legacy wide-body planes.
Content: Subscribe Now! Get features like Air India has acquired six Boeing 777-300 ER planes that were being operated on lease, marking the purchase of this category of wide-body long-range aircraft after more than seven years, according to sources. The airlines move comes against the backdrop of supply chain constraints delaying deliveries as well as refurbishment works of its legacy wide-body planes. The loss-making airline, acquired by the Tata Group in January 2022, is undergoing an ambitious five-year transformation plan, and is expanding its fleet as well as network amid rising air traffic demand. Its USD 400 million retrofit programme for 67 wide-body and narrow-body planes is also in progress. The sources told PTI that Air India has bought the six Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft that were being operated on lease. These planes were earlier operated by Etihad Airways. The purchase of these planes, having an extended range and deployed for long-haul and ultra-long-haul flights, was completed recently through the airlines wholly-owned subsidiary AI Fleet Services Ltd AIFS located in the International Financial Services Centre in GIFT City, Gujarat. Further, the sources said the lease period of these planes was to end by next year, and then, the lessor would have taken back the aircraft. In order to ensure there is enough capacity, the airline decided to acquire the planes, they added. Financial details could not be immediately ascertained. An Air India spokesperson did not offer comments on the deal. The six leased Boeing 777-300 ER planes started joining Air India fleet in 2023. These aircraft have a four-class configuration of First, Business, Premium Economy and Economy seats. This is the first time in more than seven years that Air India has purchased Boeing 777 planes. Back in 2018, the airline, then owned by the government, had taken delivery of its last B777 aircraft as part of an order announced in April 2005. Since Tata Group started piloting Air India, the airline has placed orders for 570 new aircraft. The airline has 67 legacy wide-body and narrow-body planes -- 13 B777-300 ERs and 27 B787s. The first of the legacy B787 is set to go for retrofit in June while the refit of all the 27 legacy A320 neo aircraft is expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year. Air India has 198 planes, of which 106 offer new or upgraded cabin interiors. What this means is refurbishing old aircraft in our fleet to install new seats in a three-class cabin configuration, carpets, curtains, lavatories, and more, along with a fresh coat of paint, new livery  all in the new Air India branding, the airline said in a release on April 30. On March 18, Air India CEO and MD Campbell Wilson talked about the supply situation and said there are pinch points everywhere, such as there are no engines for some narrow-body aircraft, there are issues with seat suppliers as well as availability of components and parts of fuselage. Reality is that it is going to remain a supply-constrained market, not just for Air India, India, I am talking about worldwide... for another 4-5 years, Wilson had said. At that time, he had said, We are victims of the circumstances as is every other airline. If you are capacity constrained, you have to be a little bit ruthless with respect to where you deploy your aircraft to maximise the returns. It means you cant expand to places that you otherwise would like to expand. It is not a lot that you can do beyond that. We can try to lease aircraft from the external market, but every other airline is trying to do it. Getting one or two aircraft which have a different configuration from the rest of the fleet adds to the complexity rather than advancing you. It is a very significant challenge for the industry as a whole, Wilson said on March 18.",0

The agreement, hailed as a great deal for America, grants U.S. farmers and manufacturers unprecedented access to UK markets while maintaining a 10 baseline tariff on British imports. With negotiations still ongoing, the deal offers a blueprint for future agreements but also signals that Trumpâs aggressive trade policies are here to stay. A win for American farmers and manufacturers The deal promises to unlock 5 billion in new export opportunities for U.S. producers, including 700 million in ethanol and 250 million in beef sales. The UK will reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products, Trump declared from the Oval Office. British tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods, which previously reached as high as 125, will now be slashed, leveling the playing field for American ranchers and farmers. Prime Minister Starmer, joining via speakerphone, emphasized the mutual benefits This is going to boost trade between and across our countries. Itâs going to not only protect jobs, but create jobs, opening market access. The agreement also streamlines customs procedures and strengthens intellectual property protections, ensuring U.S. firms remain competitive in the UKâs procurement market. Carveouts for luxury cars and steel One of the most notable concessions involves British automakers. Under the deal, the first 100,000 UK-made vehicles imported annually, including Rolls-Royce, Bentley, and Jaguar models, will face a reduced 10 tariff, down from 25. Additional vehicles will still be subject to the higher rate. Rolls-Royce is not going to be built here. I wouldnât even ask them to do that, Trump quipped, defending the exemption for ultra-luxury brands. Meanwhile, the UK secured relief from U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, which will drop to zero as part of a new trading union for the metals. British steel exports to the U.S., valued at 492 million last year, will now flow tariff-free in a major win for UK manufacturers. A template for future deals... or a warning? While the agreement offers a framework for negotiations with other nations, experts warn that its terms may not be easily replicated. The UK is a relatively small trading partner ... and one where the U.S. runs a merchandise surplus, making it a relatively easy case to strike a deal, noted Sarah Bianchi of Evercore ISI. The 10 baseline tariff remains intact, suggesting that countries with larger trade surpluses, like China, could face steeper demands. Trump made it clear that tougher negotiations lie ahead and that tariffs for some countries could be much higher because âthey have massive trade surpluses and, in many cases, they didnât treat us right.â The administration is already eyeing deals with Vietnam and other Southeast Asian nations. Markets react cautiously Investors initially cheered the news, with the Dow surging over 250 points, but enthusiasm waned as details emerged. The British pound dipped slightly, reflecting concerns that the deal favors the U.S. 10 tariffs are staying in place for great swathes of British exporters, but American companies selling into the UK will benefit from new cuts to duties, noted Susannah Streeter of Hargreaves Lansdown. Whatâs next? With the 90-day tariff pause set to expire in July, the pressure is on for the Trump administration to secure more agreements. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to meet Chinese officials this weekend, though Trump downplayed expectations China very much wants to make a deal. Weâll see how that works out. For now, the UK deal stands as a symbolic victory that may ease tensions but leaves many questions unanswered. As Starmer put it, The question you should be asking is Is it better than where we were yesterday?

Content: Note Here is a link to the Spanish version of this article Nota La versión en español de este artículo se puede encontrar aquí aqui Note Major update to section 1.2 made on the morning of April 29, 2025 Note also in section 1.1 Update May 3, 2025 In RED Below Note Major update to section 5.1 made on the morning of May 4, 2025 Here a Christian author explores how some of the most important messages from Jesus, which for a couple of reasons, needed to be presented in a crypticsecretive manner, are mostly to be found outside the Christian Bible, and can now be studied and properly understood. What did Jesus mean in Luke 1721 where he says,  the kingdom of God is within you.? It turns out that Jesus learned apparently a great majority of the secrets of the Freemason secret society mystery schools, and wished to share at least some of this highly secretive information with the most astute of his non-Freemason students. It turns out that this secret information can be used for either EVIL or GOOD. If Christians so choose, this information can be used to turn this planet into a paradise using nothing more than our already God-instilled abilities. Sadly however, as you will see, the Freemasons succeeded in greatly tarnishingmixing much fiction and evil with truth within the official Christian Bibles. Table of Contents - 1 Original Christianity was INSTITUTIONALIZEDPERVERTED by Freemasons! - 2 When Christians Learn that Pastors Were Given Sufficient Information All Along as taught in Seminary to know that Yahweh YHWHJehovah is NOT God, which is NOT to say that Jesus never specifically named God the father is not God. Also, recent ancient discoveries tell us who YHWH REALLY WAS! Ask your pastors what they learned about the Mesopotamian rootsorigens of the Bible and how it connects with the much older Anunnaki visitor writings. Or better yet, READ THIS ARTICLE NOW! - 3 According to the Bible which was created under the leadership of evil Freemasons, THERE IS A STRANGE CAVEAT OF NO HOPE in Christianity For TRULY NOBLE People - 4 What we ABSOLUTELY know of importance from the study of Near Death Experiences NDEs, and Past Life Reviews. - 5 Over 30 Bible Verses which demonstratePROVE that Jehovah checks all the boxes for conducting Satanic PracticesBehaviors, and is merely an EVIL Demigod no better than Satan. - 6 Conclusion Many Christians have not been red-pilled regarding the EVIL Freemason directed creation of the Christian Bible. For people who want undeniable proof as opposed to useless opinions, here in this article and within the links, I deliver in spades 1 GospelsNew Testament EPIC Truth Unveiled  Original Christianity Restored! 1.1 Proof that Apostle Paul was a Freemason Ten times Apostle Paul refers to a man named Apollos  Act 1824, 191, I Corinthians 112, 34, 35, 36 etc. However, in an ancient codex predating the Bible, Apollos is written as Apollonious. According to the 1910 Encyclopedia Brittanica, Apollos is a short version of the name Apollonius. History tells us of only one Apollonius, who lived at precisely the same time as Paul - and he was raised in Tarsus  Just Like Paul! - and he planted churches in Asia Minor  Just Like Paul! - and he traveled with a man name Titus  Just Like Paul! - and he was associated with a man named Demetrius  Just Like Paul! - and he was associated with a man named Stephanus  Just Like Paul! - and he traveled with a scribe named Demas  Just Like Paul! - and he fought wild beasts at Ephesus  Just Like Paul! - and he escaped prison by a supposed miracle  Just Like Paul! - and he was shipwrecked  Just Like Paul! Pauls Greek name is Paulus, which translates the same as A-pollos. Pauls original name was Saul, which is simply the Anglican version of Sol which means Sun, and Appollos is simply a version of Apollo who was the Greek and Roman Sun god. Roman Catholic SunBaal Worship the Satanists who wanted to change the Sabbath to Sunday - httpswww.eyeopeningtruth.comthe-papal-roman-cult-of-baal So what ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL INFORMATION does history tell us about this Satanic Freemason Apollonius of Tyana keep in mind that Apostle Paul was referred to as the spouter of lies in the Dead Sea Scrolls? I cover this in my short article Founder of Christianity Was An Imposter! - religion202012founder-of-christianity-was-an-imposter-2555721.html Additionally, from another article of mine Apollonius of Tyana a vegetarian contemporary of Jesus who lived from 15 AD. to 100 AD., or according to Wikipedia, circa 3 BC  c. 97 AD performed countless miracles healing sick and crippled, restored sight, casted out demons, etc. His birth was of a virgin, foretold by an angel. He knew scripture really well as a child. He was crucified, rose from the dead and appeared to his disciples to prove his power before going to heaven to sit at the right hand of the father. He was known as, The Son of God. However, he did admit twice that he was a magician, and so for this and other reasons, his life story, written by Philostratus in the third century C.E. was believed to be unreliable for its supernatural claims. - religion202012historical-jesus-finally-found-2555982.html Jesus was a Freemason - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vvlyTMX4-se4 So there you have it  the miracles which Jesus performed, or at least those recorded in the Bible, can now be viewed as Mystery School Magic? Is it possible that Christians have been praising a magician who happened to have some pretty good tricks, as though he were God? It also needs to be pointed out, as we explore further below, that most of these Bible recorded miracle actstricks were seemingly reconstructed from older mythology stories, but does that mean they likely never happened during the lifetime of Jesus? Well, if you consider that the Freemason knowledge of all this magic probably goes back even further in time than the time of Homer, and that Jesus was a Freemason, then clearly the answer is No. Isnt it interesting that Constantines First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea 325 A.D. was basically a huge drawn out debate over whether or not Jesus was God. That alone should tell you a great deal of what likely is going on here. Update May 3, 2025 Another take the most likely reality in my view is that not only was Jesus using secret Freemason knowledge to heal people, but he was also teaching others how to use secret Freemason knowledge to heal people SHOCKING! Dead Sea Scrolls Reveal Jesus True Plan for Humanity - httpsrumble.comv6suzqb-shocking-dead-sea-scrolls-reveal-jesus-true-plan-for-humanity.html I would be remiss if I did not also point out here a STRONG CASE that Constantine never converted to Christianity. Granted it is claimed that on his death-bed he was baptized. However, there was an excellent documentary filmed in Rome by Simcha Jacobovichi which clearly demonstrates that Constantine projected himself as a replacement God for both Apollo, the sun god, and also as a replacement God for Jesus Christ. Simcha shows how the Roman Elites, including Constantine, were secretly practicing Pagan religion in hidden basements located directly underneath the earliest Roman Christian churches! When he realized that his Christian soldiers were gaining a reputation for being the most fierce, for political reasons Constantine decided to mark the shields for all of his soldiers with a Christian cross symbol. So in reality, Constantine was more like many Satanists of today, many who also deceptively claim publicly to be Christian. Constantine arranged for his tomb-site to be surrounded by 12 disciples or 12 disciple tombs which simultaneously depict Constantine as both Jesus Simchas observation and the god of the 12 signs of the Zodiac my observation. The documentary is about 40 minutes long and is an EPIC MUST SEE Secrets Of Christianity  105  Selling Christianity - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vS7A7-KOFyMA Furthermore, some modern scholars debate Constantines beliefs and even his comprehension of Christianity. Your churches will be used to teach the Jews Satanic religion and in less than two hundred years, the whole nation will be working for divine world government. That government that they believe to be divine will be the British Empire. All religions will be permeated with Judaism without even being noticed by the masses, and they will all be under the invisible all-seeing eye of the grand Architect of Freemasonry. until mind control could be accomplished through a false religion. - General Cornwallis Provincial Grand Master Freemason of Kent and a Past Grand Warden in the United Grand Lodge of England 1781. 1.2 When I ran into the following claim, I was struck with an ah-ha moment regarding the Importance of the Gospel of Thomas. It was like the bigger picture had now been unlocked, granting me previously unattained clarity According to secret Masonic texts, Jesus Christ was a real person, and his life was recorded. The true existence of the man we call Jesus Christ was known and hidden from the public for the last 2,000 years by the secret Masonry priesthood called the Freemasons, including the Catholic Pope and Vatican. This is the remarkable story of the man we know as the Biblical Jesus Christ, Jehosuah Ben Nazaria AKA Yeshua Ben Yosef or Joshua Ben Joseph in more modern English. A man whose life begins in Judea as a child born to Mary, and trained under the Rabbi Perichiah on the mystical and exoteric teachings of the Jewish Kabbalah. At 13, he escaped to Egypt to avoid persecution. In Alexandria, he was initiated by the Koinobi in the Greco-Egyptian teachings of Ophis. But, Jehosuah discovered the true meaning of the Jewish Adonai as he used the Greco-Egyptian teachings of the Koinobi to supplement his knowledge on the Kabbalah, and even went so far as writing these teachings in the most jealously guarded Masonic text, the Maggia Jesu Christi. Initiates of course are sworn to secrecy, however Jehosuah Ben Nazaria the REAL Jesus secretly set out to share some of these Secrets with the outside world. Some of this information is recorded in the Gospel of Thomas. The truth is that the Satanist Freemasons were the gatekeepers behind what would become the Christian Bible, which sadly does NOT contain this secret knowledge Jehosuah Ben Nazaria was trying to share with the world. The Gospel of Thomas is an ancient lost Gospel manuscript found in the desert of Egypt in 1945 near Nag Hammadi. It was originally written in the First Century. Many of its contents are found in other Gospels, although it also includes important teachings by Jesus not found in the four canon Gospels. Quite a few early Christian writers mention or quote the Gospel of Thomas, so it must have been rather popular in late antiquity. It was still in circulation in the fifth and sixth centuries despite systematic attempts to suppress it. There are four manuscripts of the Gospel of Thomas currently known three Greek fragments and a nearly complete Coptic version. All three of the Greek fragments, P.Oxy 1, P.Oxy 654 , P.Oxy 655, were discovered in an ancient trash heap in Oxyrhynchus Egypt alongside a treasure trove of Christian writings, including the bulk of our earliest New Testament manuscripts. It is interesting that these manuscripts of Thomas found themselves among so many Christian documents. Thomas means twin in Aramaic and Syriac. The text portrays Thomas as the twin of Jesus  someone who has become spiritually identical to Jesus. How does Thomas do that? By achieving gnosis thereby entering the kingdom of heaven in the here and now through mystical, experiential knowledge of the true, spiritual nature of reality, especially including the ultimate nature of the self. Gnosis is something that, in principle, anyone can achieve, and the purpose of the Gospel of Thomas is to help readers reach that point where they become mystically identical to Christ himself. It is interesting to note that Jesus is never called God the Son in the Bible, but he is called the Son of God more than 50 times, and a son has a beginning. The Bible also refers to the Anunnaki watchers as sons of God, and people as sons of God. The Gospel of Thomas in verse 3 states  the Kingdom of God is within you and all around you. Those who come to know themselves will find it. And when you come to know yourselves, you will see that you are children of the living Father sons of God. But if you do not come to know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and that poverty is you. The Kingdom of God is a spiritual state of being, not a set of future events on earth, and so by achieving gnosis here and now, we can enter the Kingdom of heaven in the here and now, in addition to how we enter the kingdom of heaven when we die, trading flesh for spirit. But before attempting to further understand the Gospel of Thomas, which was lost to humanity from the 6th century AD until its 1945 rediscovery in Nag Hammadi Egypt, just know that these are veiled SECRET teachings. These are the hidden words that the living Jesus spoke and his most astute student Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down. It has been said that the secret teachings were presented in this way, because if they had been taught in plain language, then they would soon have incurred the full wrath of what were considered to be, the spiritually blind and dead, but no doubt they also needed to be wary of the Satanist Freemasons. To make sense of these sayings, we must read them through the lens of non-duality, and our shared divinity with all. But even with this insight, people still could not understand saying 7 Jesus said, Blessed is the lion which becomes man when consumed by man and cursed is the man whom the lion consumes, and the lion becomes man. Fortunately, the rediscovered Gospel of Thomas came bundled with a fragment of Platos Republic which ABSOLUTELY unlocks saying 7. The lion stands for your ego, and the man is talking about the true self within, thus yielding the following correct interpretation Blessed is the ego that becomes the true self in Christ, when consumed by the Christ, and cursed is the true self whom the false ego consumes. Here is where I learned about this The True Teachings of Jesus Have the Potential to Destroy Christianity as we Know it! w Keith Giles Love Covered Life Podcast - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vagMwZJVIILE The truth of the Gospel of Thomas in this regard cannot be denied after researching how many people are currently able to temporarily leave their physical body and enter the spiritual realm. These experiences are generally referred to as an Out of Body Experience OBE. Out-of-body experiences range from involuntary out-of-body experiences or near-death experiences that happen after or during a trauma or accident, to astral projection, in which a person voluntarily tries to leave his or her body behind and ascend to a spiritual plane where truth and clarity can be found. Interestingly, Apostle Paul in II Corinthians 1214 describes having an out-of-body experience and describes a realm caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. Modern day People who have learned how to manifest Out of Body Experiences chemicaldrug-free include NASA nuclear physicist Tom Campbell Darius J Wright Robert A. Monroe whos been out a thousand times now Another HUGE SECRET of the Masons is the ability of conscious intent to modify the physical world. I have learned over the decades of research that all the passwords of Freemasonry through and through are under the control of powerful Jews. I also know that Rabbis teach this Secret ability as recorded in their Secret Kabbalah books. 1.3 Peter Cresswell did a deep dive on the oldest writings and determined as presented in his book how the Jesus story became more and more super-human over time, further proving that the Bible variant of the Jesus story was an invention of man. In his new book The Invention of Jesus Peter Cresswell has developed some new techniques and taken an in-depth look at the earliest surviving manuscripts of the gospels describing the life and death of Jesus as well as letters, attributed to Paul and others, to the outposts of the early Church. There are papyrus fragments, some from as early as the second century, and then later manuscripts written on parchment, with fewer gaps in the text. The vast majority are written in Greek  the language of Empire and of the early Church. Cresswell carefully analyses the surviving texts to show how doctrines, such as the divinity of Jesus and the Resurrection, have been progressively introduced into the narrative. By establishing what has been added, he defines what part of the character of Jesus the Christian Church has, over time, invented. - httpsyoutu.beRRv0jgkZ8GE?t1554 1.4 And THEN we have the FOLLOWING wow, just wow... taking things to a whole new level Inescapable Evidence The Gospels Used Homer To Create Their Narratives The entirety of the Gospels was actually reconstructed using primarily whole lines of text from Homers Greek Mythology writings! - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vtozott4Q5ok - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vsn1C5q0KTao Gospel Writers COPIED Other Resurrection stories!

This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, Out of Egypt I called my son. In 1968, Catholic Priest States How Jesus went to the East, and studied with the gurus in India, he went and studied with the Lamas in Tibet, he went to Egypt and studied with the magicians there, and thats how he was able to raise the dead, walk on water, and do all these miracles.

There is a currently living person who refers to himself now as Johnofnew who kept passing by psychics randomly who would ask him if he knew that in a prior life that he was John the Baptist? At first he thought nothing of it, and it was not until the 13th person stating this that he was convinced to see a regression professional to see if there could be anything to this. He actually had his regression session recorded and can be heard absolutely wailing intensely like a child upon vividly seeing his most close friend Yeshua Ben Yosef being nailed to a cross. One thing not many people have researched deeply enough to know is that the Romans would not have nailed through the palms of hands but rather through the wrists, and so when during his regression Johnofnew pointed out this detail, it was a strong confirmation to me that his story was legitimate. According to John of New, the Apostles did NOT write the New Testament. - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vxlCUCicbMjk John of new also has a clear memory of Jeshua stating that he was NOT the Messiah Jeshua The Untold Story of the Royal Bloodline 846 - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vGwpqCTaoshI For the next claim, please keep the following in mind  I regard consciousness as fundamental.

Allowing unnecessary pain and suffering of this magnitude in just one instance is enough to cause me ETERNAL torment, so imagine how much worse it would be for me to live eternally in heaven, where sentient being animals are eternally murdered for an absolutely UNNECESSARY MEAL FOR SURVIVAL? So clearly it would seem that the modern Bible which as I have shown elsewhere was infiltrated from its inception by satanic Freemasons variant of Christianity is a farce, in that the most noble of people like myself who truly care even if it were possible for us to live a perfect life, are condemned to eternal torment with no way out, since it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to LOVE A PRO-SERIAL KILLER LIKE modern Bible JESUS! 4 What we ABSOLUTELY know from the study of Near Death Experiences NDEs, and Past Life Reviews 4.1 Regarding Near Death Experiences, first of all I have personally encountered over 20 people who have had near death experiences, some on multiple occasions. I have also encountered several people who can recall one or more past lives, some through either a process known as past life regression or an NDE experience, and others just outright who have had such memories essentially since birth. My understanding is that practically anyone can access past life memories with the help of a qualified past life regressionist. There are many cases where a child tells of a past life in sufficient detail where further research has proven to be undeniably true. So with that background I began many years later finding NDE testimony videos posted on youtube. I became more and more fascinated with these, to the point where I was oftentimes watching over 10 of these per day. In a ten year period I calculate that I have watched somewhere between 4 and 6 thousand of these videos. While each case is unique, there are at least 15 common recurrences which can be observed. Typically a person will shockingly all of a sudden realize they are no longer in pain and feel a surreal feeling of peace. They will see themselves floating above their body oftentimes not realizing initially that it is their own essentially dead body. Then they are taken away to where they are floating in a surreally black space which defies anything they have experienced in their experience on earth, or pass through a tunnel of light which takes them into a seemingly heavenlyspiritual realm of reality. In something like 75 percent of the cases, the people trapped in the dark space are visited with a spiritual entity perhaps 50 of the time perceived to be Jesus who on occasion reveals that during his physical life on earth was in reality only known as Yeshua Ben Yosef NOT Jesus which translates to Joshua Ben Joseph in more contemporary English. In perhaps 25 of the cases where the people trapped in the dark space typically people who actually truly believe in the utter complete BS concept of burning eternally in afterlifeheaven side hell, find themselves experiencing either a unique tour of hell, or even experiencing themselves suffering in some unique rendition of hell themselves. However, in 100 of these cases it is not long before they are visited by who they perceive as Jesus, who then takes them to the peaceful side of the afterlife reality. In general what they learn is that there is actually absolutely no judgement for sinful behaviors carried out on planet earth. However, in one case in my research Yeshua explains how there is a special place for the most vile of offenders, where according to Yeshua, you do not want to go there. But still, it is not anything like the concept of hell. It seems that the closest approximation to the concept of hell is what humans experience right here on planet earth. The never-ending burning of humans and gnashing of teeth, and torture of people for adrenochrome blood, all happens throughout the ages right here on planet earth. On the other side, NDEers not only experience peace and a feeling of the most surreal feeling of love imaginable, but are also brainwashed into believing that they must return to planet earth to fulfill their pre-birth contract to fulfill their supposed purpose of soul enlightenment andor helping humanity. This to me is 100 complete utter BS! As for me personally, I ABSOLUTELY KNOW WITH 100 CONFIDENCE that such level of pain and suffering is ABSOLUTELY NOT NECESSARY for me to become a 100 noble person. Sadly, the vast majority of NDEers have lacked the sufficient intelligence to come to the same conclusion. 4.2 The reality as I see it, is that we are in a 100 EVIL Reincarnation Matrix, most likely controlled to a large extent by Anunnaki Artificial Intelligence, where the AnunnakiReptilianother ETs feed off of negativesuffering energy from humans known as loosh. Thus the need to create a constant state of war and torturehuman trafficking for Adrenochrome blood in our world. We know that this has been going on since the beginning of known human history. What we can ABSOLUTELY KNOW, not as opinion, but rather as ABSOLUTE FACT, is that Christianity, Islam, and Babylonian Talmud Judaism are designed to pit each-other in constant war with each-other. The Christian Bible orders believers to go to war against ALL WHO BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU in Deuteronomy 172-5. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are all PRO-WAR-AGAINST-YOUR-NEIGHBOR! Here a Muslim woman whistle-blower testifies how Muslims in Gaza from birth are taught to 100 hate non-Muslims to the death - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vu0ja85V7Ovw However, FAR WORSE than Christianity and Islam where at least you can spare your life by pretending to convert, is Babylonian Talmud Judaism! 4.3 Verify the verses  Full Text of the English Babylonian Talmud httpwww.halakhah.com The goyim are not humans. They are beasts. Baba Mezia 114b The basic Talmudic doctrine includes more than a super-race complex. It is an only race concept A Perplexing Thought For Christians.

For almost four thousand years these five points have been the modus operandi of these evil Canaanite heirs, who are now so near to the total control of the world. 4.4 Here is John Kerry on video wearing his Israel Blue tie as Trump often does, identifying as an Extra-Terrestrial Jew Ruling Over Humanity - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vmooK4mp5teQ I have reason to believe he is actually not joking as demonstrated by the following video of a Rabbi teaching his class of Jews how they are ETs on a mission to genocide the humans of planet earth - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vGZiEkZG2S84 4.5 Also, as most Truthers should well know by now, Jews were NEVER Israelites. Jews ask any Jew and they will tell you track their family line on the womans side whereas everyone else, including the line of Jesus in the Bible are tracked on the male side. So clearly they were never the same people. JewsEdomitesPharisees are descendants of Jacobs EVIL BLOODLINE brother Esau who mated with not one but two Hittite women. My article, Something Paramount They Did Not Teach Pastors in Seminary  This Will Rock the Christian World! is one of the best and most comprehensive articles on this subject you will find anywhere. - religion201904something-paramount-they-did-not-teach-pastors-in-seminary-this-will-rock-the-christian-world-2546470.html 4.6 So, just HOW EVIL ARE THE JEWS living in modern day Israel? Remember, Israel tried to justify the October 7, 2024 massive bombing campaign on Gaza on false allegations of Hamas Raping women which was debunked in the New York Times and burning babies which was also debunked, yet Israel itself has a long history of committing both of these crimes against Palestinians. In one case they not only hospitalized a Palestinian man by inserting an entire cellphone up his now ruptured ass an event that was videotaped, but they apparently had their security dog maul him breaking bones and rupturing a lung. And what is even worse is that the majority of Israeli society seems to be in support of every last bit of this torture of Palestinians, including the raping of Palestinian children - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vd2rGpKBMxm4 In Israel it is legal to gang rape hostages including anally with a stick which apparently happens on a regular basis. In one case it was so bad that someone ordered the military police to arrest 10 Israeli soldiers who gang rapedhospitalized a Palestinian hostage. In response to this, the Israel public exploded into a civil war fury against the ass-hole who ordered the arrests, and overran two highly secured military bases in ABSOLUTE FURY as captured on video - httpswww.bitchute.comvideoyr8IuJg4dEB7 Think Israel Is Bad?

Were all being manipulated by IMPOSTERS and yall dont get it  Your neighbor is NOT your ENEMY FOOLS! But rather Governments, Religions and Fake GodsIdols ARE your ENEMY! 4.7 From the study of NDEs, we find essentially no rationale explaining why so few seem to be able to live eternally in heaven. In my view, the Anunnaki controllers first attempt to convince, oftentimes appearing as Jesus, or God, or Buddha, or prime source, or what have you, human spirits to volunteer to return back to earth perpetually to fulfill some purposecontractlife lesson or what have you. Whenever a human spirit outright refuses to go back, they are then IMMEDIATELY FORCEDSHOVED back into a human body including by the Jesus projections. These merciless slave-masters who apparently are capable of projecting onto their victims a surreal feeling of PURE LOVE, are in actuality the definition of PURE PERPETUAL EVIL. What we ABSOLUTELY know from the study of Near Death Experiences NDEs, and past life reviews, is that THERE IS NO HELL ON THE OTHER SIDE, and furthermore, THERE IS NO DEATH! So does it make any sense that Jesus would need to save Christians on the cross? Why not instead save us from the EVIL Anunnaki who are behind the Reincarnation matrix to planet EarthHell? 4.8 Hypnotherapist Steve Burgess Did 7000 Past Life Regressions and is STUNNED By What He Discovered!  weve lived thousands of lives on this planet. We also lived past lives on other planets as other lifeforms. We will incarnate as an animal occasionally. So sometimes in my therapy sessions, I have clients who go into animal past lives. - httpsyoutu.bePQiwvCXt-wY?t499 And here in the video he shares an account of client who incarnated as a fish - httpsyoutu.bePQiwvCXt-wY?t2674 So anyone who argues that it is OK to slaughter animals for food to eat, but not OK to slaughter humans for food to eat, is proven here to be NOT THINKING STRAIGHT! Sorry, but you are simply NOT TRULY A RATIONAL BEING! It would be more rationallogically trueconsistent to argue that it is OK to butcher both sentient humans AND sentient animals as a source for food to eat. Sorry, but either way, YOU SUCK ROTTEN EGGS in the WORST POSSIBLE WAY IMAGINABLE! Furthermore, the ONLY sentient beings who will, or even can, forgive you without punishment, are those who follow Satanic doctrine. The truth is that if humans were NOT sentient beings with a desire to live and having the ability to experience pain and suffering, then the Golden Rule would no longer apply. Therefore, and conversely, the Golden Rule ABSOLUTELY applies 100 to ALL sentient being creatures, INCLUDING ANIMALS! It turns out that the ethic known as Veganism, and the ethic known as the Golden Rule, are 100 EXACTLY THE SAME THING. Many people mistakenly think that veganism is a diet  it is not. For example, eating the meat from a non-intentional road kill victim is NOT a violation of the ethic known as veganism. Furthermore, true practitioners of the Golden RuleVeganism will not purchase things like a fur coat or leather shoes, again demonstrating that veganism is not a diet but rather an ethic, and in fact it is merely another name for the ethic known as The Golden Rule. Therefore, any Jesus or god who green-lights the general practice of eating meat is in violation of the Golden Rule, and is in actuality exhibiting EVIL, and is simply NOT A TRUE EMBODIMENT OF LOVE, and certainly not an ascended master of all that is good! NO DOCTOR WILL TELL YOU THAT EATING MEAT IS NECESSARY FOR HUMAN SURVIVAL. 5 The Satanic Attributes of YahwehJehovah and Jesus not to be confused with Yeshua Ben Yosef 5.1 Two curious passages in the Bible seem to equate Jehovah and Satan. The passages, which refer to the same event in the history of Israel King David orders a census of the Israelites, are as follows The anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and judah. -II Samuel 241 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. -Chronicles 211 Jehovah Is Darkness Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! To what end is it for you? The day of the LORD is darkness, and not light. As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him or went into the house, and leaned his band on the wall, and a serpent bit him. Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? Even very dark, and no brightness in it?  Amos 518-20 The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.  Exodus 2021 NIV YahwehJehovah were constantly starting wars and complete genocides including of innocents because of anti-Israelite stance only multiple generations earlier, and even including the genocide of their innocent animals - see 1 Samuel 151-3 for example, and also Joshua and Deuteronomy just like the Satanic leaders in power today. Just like a Satanist, Jehovah sets out to create evil I form the light, and create darkness I make peace and create evil I the LORD do all these things. -Isaiah 457 Jehovah once again plots to do evil Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, thus saith the LORD Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you. . . . -Jeremiah 1811 Jehovah Sends Evil Spirits Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech. -judges 923 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. -I Samuel 1614 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house. -I Samuel 1810 Jehovah Deceives And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet.. . . -Ezekiel149 Theo said I, Ah, Lord GOD! Surely thou has greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem. . . . -Jeremiah 410 0 LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed. . . . -Jeremiah 207 Jehovah Is a God of Fear Fear ye not me? Saith the LORD will ye not tremble at my presence? -Jeremiah 522 Jehovah Sets Wild Animals on Children And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children?. -Leviticus 2621-22 Jehovah Causes Cannibalism And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary to me Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. -Leviticus 2627-29 VIOLENCE and CURSES note WitchcraftSatanic spells include curses Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and curseth be he that keepeth back his sword from blood. -Jeremiah 4810 Jehovah Burns People Alive And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD and the LORD heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. And the people cried unto Moses and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched. And he called the name of the place Taberah because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. -Numbers 111-3 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the 250 men that offered incense. -Numbers 1635 Jehovah Exalts Good-Looking Hollywood-like People 18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, 19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, 20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken 21 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire he hath a blemish he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. -Leviticus 2118-21 Jehovah Treats Women as Property Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. For thou didst it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. -II Samuel1211-12 Jehovah requires wide-spread human sacrifice as a burnt offering to God Deuteronomy 1313-19  How Satanic is that? Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods. In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it. Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town must remain a ruin forever it may never be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors. The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him. In Judges 21 God orders the murder of all the people of Jabesh-gilead, except for the virgin girls who were taken to be forcibly raped and married. When his chosen wanted more virgins, God told them to hide alongside the road and when they saw a girl they liked, kidnap her and forcibly rape her and make her your wife! 5.2 It also seems pretty clear to me that slavery in the Bible greenlights rape Exodus 217 - When a man sells his daughter as a SLAVE, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. Paul states according to 1 Timothy 61-2 KJV 6 Let as many slave servants as are under the yoke, count their own slave masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. 2 And they that have Christian believing slave masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit oh, but slave Christians are NOT to partake in the benefit, but rather only the Christian slave masters - WTF?. The Bible also permits TORTURING a Slave to DEATH as long as the slave survives a minimum of 24 hours past the torture Exodus 2120-21 20 And if a man beats his male or female servant with a rod, so that he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished. 21 Notwithstanding, if he remains alive a day or two, he shall not be punished for he is his property. NKJV The Bible is PRO Multi-Generational Permanent Slavery So like JUST How EVILSatanicANTI-Golden Rule is THAT? Leviticus 2544-49 NKJV 44 And as for your male and female slaves whom you may havefrom the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves. 45 Moreover you may buy the children of the strangers who dwell among you, and their families who are with you, which they beget in your land and they shall become your property. 46 And you may take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them as a possession they shall be your permanent slaves. 5.3 Just like the Satanic Demonrats, I mean Democrats, Jesus is PRO Self-Mutilation. Matthew 1912  For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by othersand there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it. You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters,. Reading Leviticus 2629 in context, you learn that one of Gods punishments for rebelling and disobeying against him is that youll be forced to cannibalize your own children. More Pro Cannibalism Bullshit? commonly associated with Satanism - Did Constantine have a Satanic motive for including the following verses in the Bible? II kings 29 So we boiled my son, and did eat him and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him In Ezekiel 412 God orders Ezekiel to Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.

Romans 121  offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God  this is your true and proper worship., which proves that according to Paul, Christianity is a death cult. How Satanic is that? Why Christianity Checks Every Box of a Death Cult - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vNRZYlDFzGb8 - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vo4RUVTZrOKY In Rabbinical Literature, Nimrod AKA SatanMarduk is the prototype of a rebellious people, his name being interpreted as he who made all the people rebellious against God Pes. 94b comp. Targ. of pseudo-Jonathan and Targ. Yer. to Gen. x. 9. As the first hunter, he was consequently the first who introduced the eating of meat by man. He was also the first to make war on other peoples Midr. Agadah to Gen. x. 9. So there you have it. It was none other than Satan who first introduced the concept of eating meat to humans! 5.5 Did Jesus think YahwehJehovah was a lovinggood God? Jesus gives an account of the Anunnaki creation story in the once lost Gospel of Judas And look, from the cloud there appeared an angel whose face flashed with fire and whose likeness was defiled by blood. His name was Nebro Enlil in the Sumerian tablets, which means Rebel. Others call him Yaldabaoth. And another angel, Saklas Enki, came from the cloud too.  Then Saklas said to his angels, Lets create a human being after the likeness and the image, And they fashioned Adam and his wife Eve. Jesus also points out to his disciples that these Gods of Old Testament Christianityhumanity are false gods, a concept apparently beyond which any of his disciples were ever able to comprehend based upon the following interpretation by Jesus of a dream the disciples had Jesus said to them, Youre the ones receiving the offerings on the alter youve seen  and the people bringing animals to be sacrificed to the false god Enlil  one archetype of Yahweh is the crowd you lead astray. Its been said to the human generations, Look, God has accepted your sacrifice from the hands of priests, that is, the minister of error. But the Lord who commands is the Lord over everything. On the last day, theyll be found guilty. Jesus I have come to destroy the sacrifices Panarion 30.16.5, and as ascribing to Jesus rejection of the Passover meat Panarion 30.22.4, and these are analogous to numerous passages found in the Recognitions and Homilies e.g., Recognitions 1.36, 1.54 and Homilies 3.45, 7.4, 7.8. The Ebionite or Hebrew Gospel quotes Jesus as saying, I have come to abolish the sacrifices, and if you cease not from sacrificing, my wrath will not cease from you. Panarion 30.16.5 - httpsmedium.comsant-mat-meditation-and-spiritualityevidence-that-jesus-and-the-original-aramaic-christians-were-vegetarians-b8784ac42506 Clearly Jesus considered the old testament Anunnaki demigods, including YHWHJehovah, to be EVIL. 6 Conclusion If JehovahEnlil or JesusThoth were worth a nickel, one might think that we would NOT have over 50 thousand years of SatanAdrenochrome worshipritual torture abuse while humans are perpetually recycled back onto this prison planetHell. However, to the credit of the REAL Jesus, he was apparently trying to share with humanity how to escape this EVIL reincarnation matrixtrap by choosing Divinity over Slavery, Truth over Illusion, and Light over Oblivion, or in short, TO CHOOSE TO RULE WITH LIGHT! Note Here is a link to the Spanish version of this article Nota La versión en español de este artículo se puede encontrar aquí aqui Note Major update to section 1.2 made on the morning of April 29, 2025 Note also in section 1.1 Update May 3, 2025 In RED Below Note Major update to section 5.1 made on the morning of May 4, 2025 Here a Christian author explores how some of the most important messages from Jesus, which for a couple of reasons, needed to be presented in a crypticsecretive manner, are mostly to be found outside the Christian Bible, and can now be studied and properly understood. What did Jesus mean in Luke 1721 where he says,  the kingdom of God is within you.? It turns out that Jesus learned apparently a great majority of the secrets of the Freemason secret society mystery schools, and wished to share at least some of this highly secretive information with the most astute of his non-Freemason students. It turns out that this secret information can be used for either EVIL or GOOD. If Christians so choose, this information can be used to turn this planet into a paradise using nothing more than our already God-instilled abilities. Sadly however, as you will see, the Freemasons succeeded in greatly tarnishingmixing much fiction and evil with truth within the official Christian Bibles. - 1 Original Christianity was INSTITUTIONALIZEDPERVERTED by Freemasons! - 2 When Christians Learn that Pastors Were Given Sufficient Information All Along as taught in Seminary to know that Yahweh YHWHJehovah is NOT God, which is NOT to say that Jesus never specifically named God the father is not God. Also, recent ancient discoveries tell us who YHWH REALLY WAS! Ask your pastors what they learned about the Mesopotamian rootsorigens of the Bible and how it connects with the much older Anunnaki visitor writings. Or better yet, READ THIS ARTICLE NOW! - 3 According to the Bible which was created under the leadership of evil Freemasons, THERE IS A STRANGE CAVEAT OF NO HOPE in Christianity For TRULY NOBLE People - 4 What we ABSOLUTELY know of importance from the study of Near Death Experiences NDEs, and Past Life Reviews. - 5 Over 30 Bible Verses which demonstratePROVE that Jehovah checks all the boxes for conducting Satanic PracticesBehaviors, and is merely an EVIL Demigod no better than Satan. - 6 Conclusion Many Christians have not been red-pilled regarding the EVIL Freemason directed creation of the Christian Bible. For people who want undeniable proof as opposed to useless opinions, here in this article and within the links, I deliver in spades Update May 3, 2025 Another take the most likely reality in my view is that not only was Jesus using secret Freemason knowledge to heal people, but he was also teaching others how to use secret Freemason knowledge to heal people SHOCKING! Dead Sea Scrolls Reveal Jesus True Plan for Humanity - httpsrumble.comv6suzqb-shocking-dead-sea-scrolls-reveal-jesus-true-plan-for-humanity.html Thomas means twin in Aramaic and Syriac. The text portrays Thomas as the twin of Jesus  someone who has become spiritually identical to Jesus. How does Thomas do that? By achieving gnosis thereby entering the kingdom of heaven in the here and now through mystical, experiential knowledge of the true, spiritual nature of reality, especially including the ultimate nature of the self. Gnosis is something that, in principle, anyone can achieve, and the purpose of the Gospel of Thomas is to help readers reach that point where they become mystically identical to Christ himself. It is interesting to note that Jesus is never called God the Son in the Bible, but he is called the Son of God more than 50 times, and a son has a beginning. The Bible also refers to the Anunnaki watchers as sons of God, and people as sons of God. The Gospel of Thomas in verse 3 states  the Kingdom of God is within you and all around you. Those who come to know themselves will find it. And when you come to know yourselves, you will see that you are children of the living Father sons of God. But if you do not come to know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and that poverty is you. The Kingdom of God is a spiritual state of being, not a set of future events on earth, and so by achieving gnosis here and now, we can enter the Kingdom of heaven in the here and now, in addition to how we enter the kingdom of heaven when we die, trading flesh for spirit. The truth of the Gospel of Thomas in this regard cannot be denied after researching how many people are currently able to temporarily leave their physical body and enter the spiritual realm. These experiences are generally referred to as an Out of Body Experience OBE. Out-of-body experiences range from involuntary out-of-body experiences or near-death experiences that happen after or during a trauma or accident, to astral projection, in which a person voluntarily tries to leave his or her body behind and ascend to a spiritual plane where truth and clarity can be found. Interestingly, Apostle Paul in II Corinthians 1214 describes having an out-of-body experience and describes a realm caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. Modern day People who have learned how to manifest Out of Body Experiences chemicaldrug-free include NASA nuclear physicist Tom Campbell Darius J Wright Robert A. Monroe whos been out a thousand times now Another HUGE SECRET of the Masons is the ability of conscious intent to modify the physical world. I have learned over the decades of research that all the passwords of Freemasonry through and through are under the control of powerful Jews. I also know that Rabbis teach this Secret ability as recorded in their Secret Kabbalah books. For the next claim, please keep the following in mind  I regard consciousness as fundamental. We cannot get behind consciousness  Max Planck, founder of quantum theory. Resurrection Real or Myth? According to Johnofnew Yeshua did not resurrect back into his old body, but rather went to the other side , then came back to a new location and manifested a NEW body for himself around his consciousness, similar to how many gurus of Hinduism have done before and something according to Johnofnew that we are all capable of. It was NOT the intention of Jeshua that his followers would dwell on his journey to the other side and re-manifestation as a significant event. The perfect follow-up to this to add more substance and undeniable proof is the following The Ancient PAGAN Myths Behind the Bible That SHATTERED Scholarship! 2432 - httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vvkq2vYuDYyE Neither the Paul Wallis link above nor the Aaron Abke link below should be considered as Christianity bashing. In fact Both Paul Wallis and Aaron Abke consider themselves to be Christians to this day. Also, many will find that the second link casts Jesus in a BETTER LIGHT than do the Church institutions. Many people will probably find it to be quite edifying.

And he called the name of the place Taberah because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. -Numbers 111-3 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the 250 men that offered incense. -Numbers 1635 5.4 Jesus Doesnt Care About Your Feelings.

The author of this article is basically telling us Believe only in what I tell you. I am the truth! As ALWAYS, I WELCOME ANYONE to prove any of my specific arguments wrong. Oh, the rantings of bitter apostates. Christianity is the only religion in the world with strict proof that death can be defeated in and through the literal, tangible, physical, legal resurrection of Christ from the dead. This is the hope of mankind, not the pseudo-arguments of a man who thinks that he is God. It is interesting to note that Jesus is never called God the Son in the Bible, but he is called the Son of God more than 50 times, and a son has a beginning. The Bible also refers to the Anunnaki watchers as sons of God, and people as sons of God. The Gospel of Thomas in verse 3 states  the Kingdom of God is within you and all around you. Those who come to know themselves will find it. And when you come to know yourselves, you will see that you are children of the living Father sons of God. But if you do not come to know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and that poverty is you. The Kingdom of God is a spiritual state of being, not a set of future events on earth, and so by achieving gnosis here and now, we can enter the Kingdom of heaven in the here and now. Most of this is religious presumption and gobbledygook. Beware! Father GOD said, I live in the brain, heart, spirit, and body of my beloved offspring humans from birth to death unless SATAN enters, and then, I leave. Only by prayer and repentance will I return. Father GOD said, I imaged myself and my laws upon my beloved offspring humans brain, heart, spirit, and body lest any of them declare ignorance of My laws if standing in my Judgment. Therefore, all humans have bidirectional communication with Father GOD anytime and anywhere. Prayers are a template just as writing letters are a template OPENING STATEMENT Dear Father GOD  next, ASK FORGIVENESS of any disobediences you committed against Him  then, ADDRESS TOPICS you want to talk of  last, CLOSING STATEMENT In your name JESUS I pray, Amen. Your prayer  letter do not reach Father GOD unless you cite JESUS  whom delivers your prayer  letter. This method is Father GODs request to reach Him, you must include JESUS. Your message to Him can be either thought spoken or written. The discovery of blood-typing became a science in 1901. Therefore, 8.5 BILLION human cousins on Earth know their ancestors by NOAHs three sons whose BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS are visibly different 1st son SEM  SEMITE Family, descendants are WHITE skin, blood type-A, BLUE eyes, fine light-colored hair. 2nd son JAPHETH  JAPHETHITE Family, descendants are LIGHT BROWN skin, blood type-B, medium BROWN eyes, and medium BROWN wavy hair. page 2  continued. 3rd son HAM  HAMITE Family, descendants are DARK BROWN skin, blood type-B, dark BROWN eyes, and BROWN wiry hair and BLACK skin, blood type-O, BLACK eyes, and BLACK curly hair and BLACK woolly hair. Father GOD commanded STAY WITH YOU OWN KIND  DO NOT BLEND YOUR BLOOD. Blended blood is diseased by shared DNA that prevents longevity to age 120 years that Father GOD promises to His beloved offspring humans GENESIS 63. Humans who disobey Father GODs commandment DO NOT BLEND YOUR BLOOD caused permutated blood types-ABORh that is diseased blood by shared DNA thereby causing premature death. In addition, their BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS are blended thereby causing confusion of whose HUMAN FAMILY they belong! Father GOD scattered His SEMITE ARMY over Earth to eradicated evil on Earth, whereas He assigned JAPHETHITE LIGHT BROWN and HAMITE DARK BROWN, and BLACK Families to specific lands to nurture and protect Earth. WHY THEN ARE BROWN and BLACK HUMAN FAMILIES INVADING WHITE SEMITE LANDS TO GENOCIDE AND DESTROY? Because BROWN and BLACK people joined NOT HUMAN JEWS in worshiping the SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN for which they, too, shall die daily in Hell for an eternity as Father GOD promises unless BROWN and BLACK people pray to Father GOD Jesus for His forgiveness and cease the worship of the SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN evil behaviors. page 3  continued. NOT HUMAN JEWS blood type-Rh abbreviates Rhesus monkey blood strain. In the Book of JOHN, Chapter 8, JESUS said to the JEWS, YOU are NOT HUMANS  YOU are the serpent seeds of YOUR daddy SATAN  YOU worship the Synagogue of SATAN. Therefore, JESUS was broadcasting to the worlds humans and future human generations to be cautious of JEWS, the GENOCIDERS on Earth. NOT HUMAN JEWS seven 7 evil behaviors are written in PROVERBS 616-19 that Father GOD warns His beloved offspring humans not to imitate. NOT HUMAN JEWS are the renegade angels that Father GOD said He judged in the Heavens for causing an insurrection, murdered many of His righteous angels, and attempted to USURP Father GODs Creation because He refused to reverse His servitude order from angels serving humans to humans serving His servant angels. such arrogance from servants! NOT HUMAN JEWS were judged to die daily in Hell for an eternity, and then, cast upon Earth to roam until humans Day of Judgment at End of Time. Father GOD says His renegade angels rape His humans for bodies. Father GOD said, I gave the JEWS as slaves to my HEBREWS for Millennia. Therefore, the names JEW and HEBREW are not interchangeable, and NOT HUMAN and HUMAN are not interchangeable beings. JEWS usurped the heritage of WHITE SEMITE HEBREWS just as JEWS sought to USURP Father GODs Creation in the Heavens, and their angel bodies were burned. Notable SEMITES are page 4  continued. Abram the Hebrew, his son ISAAC, his son JACOB-ISRAEL, and his 4th son JUDAH Royal Tribe. JUDAHs descendants are DAVID, his twin sons SOLOMON and NATHAN who procreated descendants MARY of SOLOMON and JOSEPH of NATHAN. MARY of SOLOMON and Father GODs Holy Spirit created JESUS, whom is Father GOD in the flesh who came to Earth as a sacrifice to save all of His beloved offspring humans from the 2nd death of Hell. Earth and humans are a gift from Father GOD to JESUS, himself. By the way, Father GOD abandoned JACOB-ISRAELs 11 of 12 Tribes for IMMORAL behaviors. Therefore, the JUDAH SEMITES are the remaining ARMY OF GOD on Earth where HE scattered them to eradicate evil on Earth. TWO-THIRDS of the worlds population heard  obeyed Father GOD in year 2020 when He informed humans brains, Do not allow COVID19 to be injected into you, it is GENOCIDAL. People who ignored Father GODs instruction to avoid the genocidal jab died, and others are dying by the COVID19 genocidal jab that NOT HUMAN JEWS are 100 responsible who published throughout the 20th Century in newspapers, books, conference speeches, and letters to their world communist leaders of coming to Earth to GENOCIDE humans and DESTROY Earth. Do as Father GOD commanded humans to do read our USER MANUAL, His HOLY BIBLE. Commune with Father GOD on His Holy day SUNDAY, and rest with Him. Father GOD cherishes His day of rest and being with page 5  continued. His beloved offspring humans more than any other day of the week. HE educates His humans of His Holy Bible, and on matters important to each human that is tailored instructed to each humans needs and wants.

"Title: Best Nebraska Sportsbooks - The Top NE Sports Betting Sites
Description: Find our full list of the best sportsbooks that are available online in the state of Nebraska here.
Content: Home  Best Nebraska Sportsbooks Modified April 25, 2025 - Dustin Williams Find the best Nebraska sportsbooks below. Our list features a range of different sports betting sites including a number of offshore sportsbooks. You can also find our list of the best Nebraska online casinos here. Although sports betting in Nebraska is yet to be regulated, it hasnt stopped many enthusiastic gamblers from placing bets across sports in the state. Thats because certain top-notch offshore licensed sportsbooks offer sports betting services to players in Nebraska. In this comprehensive guide, we will be taking a deep dive into sports betting in Nebraska, giving you a full tour on how to get started, where to bet, and the current gambling laws in the state. So, if you live in Nebraska and you want to get in on the action, read this extensive guide before you jump into placing bets. Lets go! With so many sportsbooks online today, its not easy to keep the pace of vetting every new entrant. As a result, players need to have a guide to help them find the right one to join. Even though there are no sportsbooks licensed in the state, players can check out offshore and out-of-state-licensed sports betting sites. Therefore, we have a process in place, to ensure that we only recommend the best sportsbooks for you. The market range featured is crucial, and if a sportsbook doesnt offer enough, we wont be recommending it. As you may expect, we will look at the different types of sports on offer in the sportsbook section. Then, we ask whether they cover all the popular sports and the not-so-popular ones. Most sportsbooks cover popular sports including basketball, tennis, football, soccer, etc. However, we choose sites that cover others such as snooker, bowling, bandy, etc. We do not only look at the markets we also consider the odds available to ensure that you only create accounts at sports betting sites that offer a fair return on your winning stakes. Sportsbook bonuses and promotions are usually one of the main reasons bettors decide to join an operator. Although we might want to consider other factors more crucial, we can agree that bonus offers are vital, so we evaluate them very closely. We do not just view the size we also check their terms and conditions, as they can make or break a bonus. Payment methods are critical to your online gambling experience. It is essential to know what banking options are available in the sportsbook so we ensure that we keep an eye on them whenever we are evaluating a sports betting site. In addition, we check how long deposits and withdrawals can take, what the minimum or maximum transaction size limits are, and whether you need to pay fees for each transaction. Popular payment methods include PayPal, Skrill, Neteller and Bitcoin. Every top online sports betting site features live betting to its bettors, but the live betting experience quality can vary. Therefore, we evaluate the live betting feature in question, from the bet market range to the platforms ease of use, to ensure that you only get the best live betting sites. We also check if the betting site offers live streaming, and if it does, we will look at the different sports covered in the live coverage. Online sportsbooks are not yet legal in Nebraska as a result, theres no controlling body or authority to license and regulate sports betting sites. However, players can always join sportsbooks licensed elsewhere whenever they want to start placing bets in the state. In addition, we check if these sportsbooks take the appropriate steps to protect and secure players and their details by using SSL encryption for every transaction. If there is the slightest concern about the security of an online sports betting site, we wont put it on our recommended list. Sports betting in the US is not straightforward as many states are yet to legalize it, while some are in the process, and others have fully legalized the law on sports betting. Nebraska is one of the states in legalizing sports betting as the bill that legalizes pari-mutuel race tracks was signed into law recently. However, there is not much about when sports betting will be legal in the state. Although, as things stand, it is clear that bettors within the borders of the states are not allowed to participate in online gambling, people still engage in the activity. Most bettors find solace in offshore gambling sites that accept players from Nebraska. This section will cover the progress of sports betting in Nebraska starting from May 14th, 2018, when the US Supreme Court voted to overrule the PASPA act that saw the end of the federal ban on almost all forms of gambling in different parts of the US. After that, on November 03, 2020, voters decided to legalize games of chance at racetracks in Nebraska, and a few months later, on May 21, 2021, the state legislators approved a bill designed to legalize games of luck, including betting on sports. On June 1st, 2021, Governor Pete Ricketts signed the bill into law even though he previously opposed gambling. Even though online gambling is yet to be legalized in the state, you still have to pay tax on winnings due to gambling. So, whenever you manage to win, you are required to file it in your report to the IRS. However, you only need to pay the federal tax on all that you win over 600. You withhold 24 of all your wins and send them to the federal government in the state. Please note that you can get part of the money back as a rebate based on your annual income. In addition, you need to pay income tax in Nebraska. In this case, you need to file around 5 of your wins. Like the federal taxes, you can always get part of the money back based on your income throughout the year. Undoubtedly, regardless of the current absence of regulation in the state, you can bet on various sports within the state. All you need is to sign up at an offshore sportsbook. You can pick any one of them on our list. Once you do that, you can place bets on football games, the NBA, NHL, MLB, college football  basketball, soccer, and the NFL. There is no shortage of options, as long as you pick from our recommended list. The selection is not on major sports but also the other types. When you join one of our recommended sportsbooks in Nebraska, you can find different kinds of sports. They include MMA, golf, motor racing, rugby, dart, table tennis as well as a host of others. Additionally, you can bet on sports as they happen to live and whenever there is a significant event such as the Olympics, Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup. Aside from that, you can participate in eSports betting, horse racing and daily fantasy sports betting. We have sites that specialize in the following sports within our list of the best Nebraska sportsbooks You can experience betting on eSport leagues and games when joining any top Nebraska offshore betting site. With this type of sports betting becoming very popular in the US, most sportsbooks now cover many major leagues and games. Some notable ones you will get the chance to bet on include League of Legends, DOTA 2 and CS GO. Horse race betting is very much legal in Nebraska. You can visit the local tracks if you want to bet on horse racing. However, if youre going to give it a try online, you can also check out the different sportsbooks we have on our list to get started. Although daily fantasy sports like sports betting are not technically legal in the state, people still try their hands on DFS. There are currently numerous out-of-state-licensed DFS platforms that accept players from the state. You can join any of them without worrying about conviction as there is no stringent law against participating in DFS betting in Nebraska. Every top sportsbook in Nebraska offers different betting options so that bettors can find something they prefer. Some of these markets are easy, while some require some explanations. In that case, below are some of the popular betting market types. This is the simplest betting market type you will find at Nebraska betting sites. It is purely betting on the team who you think would win in a matchup. It should be your first go-to bet if you are new to sports betting. In this case, you are betting on whether the games outcome would end in a total point over or under the set total. For instance, in a football match, the sportsbook can set the total at 37.5 you are to choose whether the game will end in more or fewer points than the total points if it ends in 38 combined points, an Over bet wins. Anything below that means the under bet is successful. Parlay bets are simply placing multiple options in one wager. In this case, you can choose various bets from different matchups and sports together. The odds for each option are multiplied by the amount you want to play. Note that all bets have to win in order for the parlay to be paid out. Props bet are specials that you place without affecting the games outcome. It can be on a single player or individual team. Some props bets can even be on off-game events like who would win the coin toss, for example. You can also bet on long-term events like who will win the super bowl even before the start of the regular season, or who will be the top goalscorer for the new MLS season? There are plenty of options available, it just depends on the sports betting site you decide to join. There is a common aspect with all top Nebraska sportsbooks. They share some incredible promotions and bonuses. Undoubtedly, these play vital roles in the gambling world as they help attract new players and keep existing ones. Some popular bonuses at top Sportsbooks in Nebraska are highlighted below. This is the most popular bonus most sportsbooks offer, especially new players. In this case, players get a 100 or any other percentage deposit match up to a specific amount. For instance, if you deposit 100, you will get another 100 in bonus funds. Opposite to the match deposit bonus. Here, you do not need to deposit any amount before claiming the offer. It is mainly offered to new players once they complete their registration. You can use the bonus to bet on different sporting events. Free bets are usually offered to allow you to bet on games without risking your real money. When you get free bets, you can bet on different options as long as they are within the scope of the terms and conditions. You can receive a certain percentage of the money you wager as cashback when you lose a bet. Depending on the bonus terms, it can be around 10, 20, 50, and so on.

Description: Welcome to the only place youll ever have to visit to learn how to read betting odds. If youre new to the world of sports betting sites, it may look a bit
Content: Home  How To Read Betting Odds Modified April 25, 2025 - Dustin Williams Interested in sports betting but unsure how to understand the odds? Fear not, our complete guide to understanding betting odds below will tell you all you need to know about how to read betting odds. Welcome to the only place youll ever have to visit to learn how to read betting odds. If youre new to the world of sports betting sites, it may look a bit daunting at first but were here to shed some light on how it works and hopefully turn you into a pro in a matter of minutes. There are hundreds of sportsbooks available online and while their offers and promotions differ, how to read odds will always be the same. This doesnt mean that real money sportsbooks will offer the same odds on the same events, and well explain why further down, but they will display odds exactly the same. You will come to learn that there are three different ways odds can be presented American, fractional, and decimal. Theres no difference in how they pay out on winning bets. Theyre merely different ways of presenting odds. Well walk you through how to read betting odds on all three types and how to swiftly calculate your potential winnings on single-event bets. If youre planning to rack up winnings from parlay bets, then itll be a little more complicated, and knowing how to read betting odds will not be enough. But dont worry. There are betting calculators out there to help you along and well go through the ones youll need. Now that you know what to expect from this guide on how to read betting odds. Lets get started by explaining what betting odds are and how they are determined. Essentially, betting odds are a representation of what you need to wager or what you could win or both wager and win depending on how they are expressed. Sportsbooks use complex algorithms to determine their odds, and odds can change at any given moment depending on external factors. Its easy to understand that the Los Angeles Lakers would be heavy favorites to win against Sacramento Kings. But if LeBron James and Anthony Davis are both unavailable to play for whatever reason, the Kings chances of winning would definitely be improved. Which would move the odds to show the level playing field. This is only one way how to read betting odds. Without any knowledge of LeBron and Davis not playing, youd still be able to figure out that somethings up because the odds are closer than they normally would be. Now, lets go into the three different ways odds are presented in sportsbooks. How to read betting odds in the American format is easy to understand as long as were talking about betting on a single outcome. But as soon as we get into calculating odds for parlay bets or potential winnings or risks for smaller amounts, American odds quickly becomes harder to calculate than cracking the DaVinci code. The system is based on asking two questions Heres how it works. American odds are presented as a number with a plus sign  or minus sign - in front to indicate which outcome is the favorite and which is the underdog. The favorite is the one with a minus sign. If you want to bet on the favorite to win on the moneyline and the odds are -250, then you would have to bet 250 to win 100. Conversely, if the odds are 250, then you would win 250 with a 100 wager. Its all well and good as long as youre willing to bet with hundreds. To bet smaller or bigger you will have to do some maths to figure out the riskreward potentials. First, you need to convert American odds into decimal numbers Now that you have the decimal numbers, you simply multiply them with your stake to get your potential payout if you win. If you wager 25 on odds of -250, your potential winnings are 25 x 1.4  35. Your stake is always a part of the payout which makes the true earnings in this case 10 35  25. Knowing how to read betting odds and converting them into decimals is half the battle. It gets easier from here on. Simply take each decimal number and multiply them all up to the final factor. Using the conversions above a parlay bet with the two outcomes at -250 and 250 1.4 and 3.5 is simply 1.4 x 3.4  4.76. Multiply 4.76 with your stake and you have your winnings. Adding more bets legs to your parlay means that you have more numbers to multiply this way. This is why parlay betting is so popular. With just a handful of bets on a single bet slip, you can reach a very high potential payout even when youre only betting on massive favorites to win. And this is how to read betting odds in the American format. Now well take a look at how they do it overseas. Most people will shy away from calculating fractions, but not in the United Kingdom. Theyve embraced it and now this is how they express odds for sports betting. Fractional odds arent that complicated for single outcomes because the formula is straightforward. Its self-explanatory when you look at how fractional odds are displayed. Its also embedded in how we speak when we talk about probability. Fractional odds look like 81 or 72 and so on, and are spoken as eight to one and seven to two. In these two examples, you would have to bet 8 to win 1 or 7 to win 2. Calculating bet sizes and winnings get a little tricky but dont worry, were here to show you how to read betting odds also when theyre expressed as fractions. This is how it breaks down for a 10 bet on an outcome with odds of 72. First, we have to assign some terminology to the different numbers to make the formula understandable. The 72 is numeratordenominator and the stake is 10. Well do this in three easy steps There you have it. A 10 bet on odds of 72 pays out 45. Lets see what happens when you bet on a parlay with two events priced at 81 and 72. Again, we start by converting the fractions which is easy. All you have to do is divide the fractions and then add 1 to get to the decimal number. Then we multiply the decimal numbers and get 9 x 4.5  40.5. A 10 bet on this would net you 405. Finally, well look at how to read betting odds with decimal numbers. By a landslide, this is the easiest way to calculate odds and possible winnings which is why most professional bettors prefer to use decimal odds. You will probably still need a calculator, but at least you can skip straight to the good stuff and skip all those pesky conversion formulas. Rather than asking yourself how much you have to stake to win or wrap your head around how to read betting odds with complicated conversions, understanding decimal odds is a walk in the park. There are two things you need to know and neither requires maths. The lower decimal number is the favorite, and the wider the gap to the opposite outcome the more favored the other outcome is to win. In other words, odds of 1.10 vs 9.90 is a massive favorite to win. To calculate your winnings potential, just multiply your stake by the decimal number. With all the conversions already done for you, adding legs to your parlay and figuring out the possible gain is simple. Add as many legs as you want and then multiply them all together and then multiply the answer with your stake. We probably dont need to give you an example of how to read betting odds here. Lets kick it up a notch and discuss the implied probability of your bet slip bearing fruit once youve settled in with your selections. We use implied probabilities in everyday language without paying attention to how we get to the chance of something happening because most of the time we simply pull numbers out of thin air. Next time you listen to the weatherman and he talks about the chance of precipitation, youll hear him say it as a percentage. Tomorrow theres a 75 chance of precipitation, for example. But how did he arrive at that number? By calculating the implied probability. Here were going to show you how to calculate the probability, as a percentage, of any bet winning using all three types of odds. Obviously, decimal odds are the easiest  again. To apply the implied probability is more of a gut feeling. If you are XX confident that an outcome will happen. Then go ahead and place your bet. All of the things youve learned so far can be done in a matter of seconds when you use betting calculators. The best sportsbooks usually have them at the ready on their sites. Simply fill out the fields and click the button to get the answers youre looking for. Still, understanding the computations for how to read betting odds is incredibly important. What if you lose your internet connection or your smartphone runs out of battery? Then you have the advantage of going old school and using a pen and paper. The betting calculators you want to be on the lookout for are the parlay and odds calculators. These will handle all the computations in any odds format. Weve shown you numerous examples of how to read betting odds in different formats and how to convert them into implied probabilities. Armed with this new knowledge you can bet like a pro on any sport by doing some quick calculations. Sportsbooks dont always offer the same exact odds on the same outcomes because they have to be competitive against each other. And they use implied probabilities to move the line to give themselves an edge. You can easily get the upper hand by signing up with several sportsbooks so you can compare odds between them and make sure youre always getting the best price for your money. There is also the opportunity to place a wide variety of bets such as parlays, hedge betting, spread betting, futures betting, moneyline betting, overunder betting and more. Apply what youve learned here today to improve your betting strategies by taking calculated risks thatll see your winnings increase over time.

You need to know how much money you stand to win or lose before placing your bets and then follow through with those bets until they are completed. Well discuss everything theres to know about sportsbooks, so you have a better understanding before placing your first bet. When looking for the best real money online sportsbooks in Kansas, we ensure the sportsbook follows all legal regulations and requirements to be a registered, legitimate business. We also looked at the casinos that offer the best betting options. If youre not familiar with the different betting options, the next section will help you out. These are the steps you need to take to register and place a bet at the Kansas online sportsbooks weve listed 1. Select your preferred sportsbook. 2. Register an account by filling out a form with your contact details, including your name, email address, and phone number. You will also be asked to choose a unique username and password for your account. 3. Make a deposit using one of the available payment methods, such as a credit card or prepaid card. 4. Find the sport that interests you and select it from the list of sports on offer from the bookmaker. For example, click on the American Football tab if you want to bet on football. Similarly, if you want to bet on soccer, click on the Soccer Football tab. 5. Once you have found a match you want to bet on, click on it and then select your stake amount and type of wager you want to make e.g., moneyline. 6. Click Confirm Bets and wait for confirmation that the system has accepted your bet before leaving the page or closing any tabs. We looked for the best sportsbooks in Kansas that offer betting options on various games, teams, and individual players. The most popular sports for betting in Kansas are football and basketball. Betting on these sports is easy, as they have a large following in the state, so sportsbooks make sure to cover them in great detail. To make a bet at Sportsbooks in Kansas, you need only provide your name, address, phone number, email address, and any other information that may be required by law. The odds offered by sportsbooks in Kansas vary depending on what type of game or event you would like to place your bet on. You can choose to place bets on NBA games, NFL games, college football games, NASCAR races, or any other available sport. Once you select, the sportsbook will give you an estimated amount of money you stand to win if your bet wins. Well now discuss the bets you can place with our top sportsbooks. In moneyline betting, you bet on the winner of a game. It doesnt matter if its a team sport or an individual sport  if theres a winner and loser, you can make a moneyline bet. The key here is only two possible outcomes win or lose. The simplicity of these bets makes them incredibly popular for those who are just getting started with sports betting. Live betting is a great way to take advantage of your sporting knowledge. For example, lets say youre watching a basketball game and one team dominates another. If you think that the other team can make a comeback based on their history, you can bet on them while the game is still on! Live betting can be fascinating because you can watch how your bet unfolds right before your eyes. Spread betting is the wagering of money based on the outcome of an event with a specific result. The spread is the number of points you must cover to win your bet. For example, lets say you want to bet on the Kansas City Chiefs, who are currently favored by 8.5 points over their opponents, Denver Broncos. If you place a spread bet on Kansas City, they would have to win by nine or more points for you to win your bet. If they only won by 7 points, your bet would be a loss because they did not cover the 8.5-point spread that was determined by the sportsbook. Kansas City could still win the game, however, you would lose your money. The point spread is determined through statistical analysis and other factors relating to both teams for it to be as accurate as possible when predicting how many points will be scored during any given match between those two teams. The total bet is different from traditional wagers placed on games because it allows you to wager how many combined points or runs will be scored during a game instead of selecting a single team to win. Betting totals are generally a 5050 proposition, while traditional bets favor the team thats perceived to be more likely to win the game. For example, if you believe that both teams playing in an NFL game will score a combined 70 points or more during the game, you can place a total bet of over 69.5 points being scored by both teams combined. If the teams score 70 points or more combined during the game, you win the bet. The same goes for betting under 69.5 points being scored by both teams combined. If the total points scored by both teams is 69 or fewer, then you win your total bet. Futures bets are made on the outcome of an event that will take place in the future. The event may have already started, but it wont be completed until later. For example, sportsbook futures bets can be placed on whether or not a particular team will win a championship. This type of bet may be made before the season begins or even after being underway for several weeks. These bets are wagers on a specific outcome of an event that is not directly related to the final score. Prop bets can be found in every sport, and they include factors like betting on the total number of points scored by both teams in a single game or whether a particular player will score in a certain period. They are often entertaining and add excitement when watching games. Parlay bets are a popular wager in sports betting. A parlay bet combines two or more individual wagers into one bet. When creating a parlay bet, you select two or more games to bet on, and it is paid out if all the games win.

"Title: Best MLB Betting Sites - The Top Baseball Sportsbooks
Description: Baseball is regarded as one of the greatest pastimes in American history and remains one of todays most popular sports. This includes Major League Baseball
Content: Home  Best MLB Betting Sites Modified April 24, 2025 - Dustin Williams MLB comes with huge betting interest from fans all across the world. If you are interested in placing wagers on MLB games then check out our list of the best MLB betting sites below. Baseball is regarded as one of the greatest pastimes in American history and remains one of todays most popular sports. This includes Major League Baseball MLB, which Americans across the country watch and cheer on. Of course, with a sport that holds this level of popularity, sports betting and baseball go hand in hand. Many Americans buckle in and start placing their bets online, but how do you identify the best MLB betting site? This article will explain what Major League Baseball betting is, how to identify the best site to bet on and how to read and understand betting odds. We will explain why we recommend certain requirements and what we look for from the best MLB betting sites that the industry has to offer. While there are certain common elements all sportsbooks should comply with, there are specific elements we look out for when finding the best MLB betting site. This includes the odds offered when the lines are released and the types of bets offered. The best sportsbooks should offer competitive odds on MLB. This means its time to do some odds shopping, and we ensure that you receive the best odds possible. Since there are different types of bets, the MLB betting site mustnt just offer one type of odds, like for moneyline betting, which is a simple minusplus number, but also other types. This includes OVERUNDER odds and Runline odds. We ensure that the site has researched the market themselves before offering odds, including what the market thinks about the match and their research on the match odds. While the odds on different sportsbooks are usually relatively close to another, some might be drastically different because of the bets that the bookmaker already accepted. This means if they have a large influx of bets on one team winning, they might adjust the odds to balance the books again. It might also be more lucrative to bet at another site. Looking at when the lines are released is another factor we consider. We want a bookmaker that releases the lines early, or at least in the expected period that other sites release their lines. Its also better if the sportsbook has a variety of lines available to bettors. We want access to both a diverse set of information as well as lines to ensure you will receive the latest market updates. Multiple bet options are the way to go at online sportsbooks. We found its best when you have your choice between futures betting or live betting, between Totals betting and Runline betting. This is also vital if you want to make Parlay bets, where you combine different bets on one bet slip. Not all bets have to be related to a matchs outcome, as there are also Prop bets. Prop bets usually revolve around individual player statistics, like the number of runs a particular player will get or how many strikeouts they will have. This makes betting on a game more exciting and great for making a Parlay bet. Another favorite where prop bets can crop up is during live betting. Live betting refers to bets placed during a match. Multiple bets can be placed in real-time and allow players a more invested match experience. This can range from making a bet if a player who scored two runs will also manage to score a third or fifth run. A wide variety of betting options only ensures you have the best possible experience when betting on Major League Baseball to ensure it stays fun. With the MLB betting market being as big and as popular as it is, its easy to be lost and unsure when trying to find a reliable and good sportsbook. This is why we outlined several factors to consider when choosing the best online MLB betting site and did the research for you. The MLB betting site should not only be licensed and have various banking options and bonuses, but it should also offer you a variety of odds, betting lines, and bets. If the MLB betting site has all these elements, we assure you that it will be a worthwhile experience to play there. Remember, its vital to ensure the sportsbook is legal in your state and that it offers what youre looking for in an MLB betting site. Keeping the above requirements in mind, we identify some of the best MLB betting sites to start your bet slip at. Major League Baseball has a six-month-long season, making it the perfect sport to bet on when the NBA and NHL are shut down in summer. With the volume of games that MLB offers bettors, theres always something happening to bet on. In a standard season, teams play 162 games each. Adding this together with the play-offs for the world series gives you multiple betting opportunities over the six-month period. It also provides you with a variety of bet types available when making bets. While there are many betting types, this article will explain four of the most frequent bet types for MLB sportsbooks. The best MLB betting sites will offer you all possible bets, including live betting, futures betting, and prop betting. Moneyline bets are, simply put, wagers that are made on which team will win a match. It is one of the favorite types of bets for Major League Baseball, as it doesnt have any margins by which the bettor can win or lose. Their bet will either be a win or a loss depending on if their chosen team wins, regardless of how they won. The odds for this bet are generally American minusplus odds, with the favorite to win having minus odds and the underdog having plus odds. It can also happen that both teams have minus odds, which usually only happens if the teams have about an equal chance of winning. Totals betting, or OVERUNDER betting, is when you bet on if the total number of runs will be more or less than the bookmakers selected total. This means it doesnt matter which team wins, as all that matters is the cumulative amount of runs scored between the two teams. If a bookmaker sets the total runs scored at 7.5 and the match ends with a score of 5-3, the total runs scored is eight and therefore OVER the bookmakers total. If you had a bet UNDER, you would lose your bet. However, if you bet OVER, you would win your bet. If the exact number of runs is scored as the bookmaker predicted, it results in a tie, and all bets are returned. This is why most bookmakers set the estimate at a half-point number, like 7.5 instead of seven or eight, to ensure there are no ties. Runline betting is similar to point spread betting in basketball and football, but for baseball. A runline bet is when you make a bet on which team will win or lose and the number of runs they will win or lose by. The bookmaker will set the underdogs to receive more runs, with the favorite receiving fewer runs. This means that the bookmaker will set the run odds for the favorite and the underdog. Generally, the favorite is set at -1.5 runs, while the underdog is set at 1.5 odds. This means that you can either bet that the favorite will win by two or more runs or that the underdog will lose with precisely one point in order to win your bet. With the vast amount of games being played in a Major League Baseball season, parlay bets are a popular option when trying to score a big win. Parlay bets refer to when you have a betting ticket that contains multiple bets. You can combine the bet types and bet on two to ten matches. This means you can make several bets on different matches or several different bet types on one match. For example, you can bet which team you believe will win, whether the total runs will be OVERUNDER the bookmakers runs, and that the winner will win with more than two runs. However, the catch in this bet type is that all your bets have to result in a win for the bet slip to be considered a win. If you made ten bets and only one resulted in a loss, the entire slip will be settled as a loss. Many real money online sportsbooks are available to American players, so it becomes more critical to ensure you are playing at the best MLB betting sites possible. There are several betting site requirements that we recommend the best sportsbook have, whether youre betting on MLB or any other sport. We will be looking at the different requirements and explaining why its important. Weve done the research for you to deliver the best MLB betting sites. One of the first things we check with any online betting site is whether they are both licensed and regulated. The licensing authority always regulates a licensed online casino, which ensures the casino is fair and follows all legislation and regulations. There are several licenses a casino can hold, from US licenses to offshore licenses. There are seven possible US licenses issued by the online gaming authorities in Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, West Virginia, and Nevada. With US federal law stating no interstate sports betting is allowed, these licensing authorities can only license online casinos or online sportsbooks available in their state. This means its not available to players from other states. However, that is not a problem, as you can still bet at offshore licensed casinos or sportsbooks. Offshore licensing refers to when a non-US gaming authority licenses a casino. Some of the best offshore licenses are the United Kingdom Gaming Commission, Curacao eGaming, Malta Gaming Authority, and the Gibraltar, Kahnawake, and Panama licenses. There are many more offshore licenses, but these are the ones encountered most frequently and are the most trusted outside the US. Playing in the US, it is essential to find out what banking methods are available to you. With the federal law on sports betting restricting or outright banning financial transactions with online gambling providers, many banks and credit card companies dont allow transactions with online casinos or sportsbooks. This means that US players often have no choice but to use a middleman payment method. As a result, the most popular payment method is PayPal, seeing as most US citizens have easy access to PayPal. We recommend that the online casino or sportsbook must offer many different payment methods so that you have different options even when some are not available to you. This includes Skrill, Neteller, Online banking ACH, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which is regularly seen throughout offshore sportsbooks. Arguably, one of the best aspects of online casinos and sportsbooks is their bonuses. Bonuses act as incentives for players to sign up, with welcome bonuses offered, as well as other bonuses like free bets to keep the bettors betting at that sportsbook. This includes bonuses like a cashback and VIPloyalty program and daily, weekly or monthly bonuses. Were always on the lookout for the best possible bonuses. Many welcome bonuses at online sportsbooks either offer you free bets or risk-free bets. You can receive a risk-free bet up to a certain amount in the first 24 hours, or the online sportsbook will state that all bets up to a certain amount in the first 24 hours are risk-free. This means if your bet results in a loss, you will be credited your bet amount. This is generally a first deposit bonus. Free bets refer to when the sportsbook awards you with a certain amount of bonus cash to make bets with. This can be either a no deposit bonus you receive when signing up, or it can be part of your first deposit bonus, where between 100 and 500 of your deposit will be given to you as bonus cash to make free bets with. After choosing your sportsbook, simply click the Sign Up button and enter your details. This will often include your name and surname, birth date, email, mobile number, and address. After that, you can check the welcome bonus and make your first deposit before you start betting. The best MLB betting sites will have competitive odds and various lines and bet types available. They will offer not only a welcome bonus but also other bonuses to keep you enjoying the site. There will be a variety of deposit and withdrawal methods available and their interface will be easy to use. If youre an MLB player or employee, its illegal for you to place bets on Major League Baseball. However, MLB betting is legal in all states where sports betting is legalized.",0

With this welcome bonus, players can get a 100 deposit match bonus of up to 500 on their first deposit. Once the deposit is made, the bonus amount will be released in increments based on the amount of poker points earned, such that for every 150 reward points earned, 5 of the reward is released. The Bovada Rewards promotion is a program that allows players to earn points every time they place a bet or even play casino games. Often, players are automatically enrolled upon signing up, and their points accumulate over time. These points can then be redeemed for cash, bonuses, or any other perks available. Also, the more points you earn, the higher your reward level, which in turn unlocks better redemption rates and benefits. The Mega Scratch Card promotion offers players the chance to win exciting prizes simply by playing virtual scratch cards. To qualify for this promotion, players must make a deposit of at least 150 in one transaction and wager a total of 500 in six days.

With this promotion, players who refer their friends using their unique referral link will receive a 200 match bonus based on the friends first deposit amount. Bovada offers a variety of deposit and withdrawal options to accommodate the diverse preferences that its players have when it comes to making payments. The banking options available for players cover both conventional and modern payment methods and everything in between. Below are the banking options that players on Bovada Casino can use For the players who prefer physical checks, Bovada Casino offers a courier delivery service for payouts. While the check by courier provides a tangible payment option that some players may like, it comes with a higher minimum withdrawal limit and a slower processing time that may take between 10 to 15 days before it is complete. Bovada Casino supports bank wire transfers as a banking option for withdrawing winnings from its platform. This method is preferred by players who like having their winnings sent directly to their bank accounts. However, despite being a secure mode of payment, bank wire transfers are not the fastest, as their processing times range from 5 to 10 business days. Bovada Casino supports using debit and credit cards from major card providers such as Visa and MasterCard. Players have a minimum deposit requirement of 20 and enjoy instant processing. However, it is important that players check with their banks to confirm their eligibility for gambling and any additional fees that may be charged. Bovada Casino supports the use of digital wallets like Voucher and Match Pay. These two digital wallet platforms operate on a peer-to-peer system that allows the transfer of funds from one player to another. Digital wallets allow players to enjoy seamless deposits and withdrawals and no minimum deposit amounts, making them a good option for players who want to wager using small amounts. As a crypto-friendly platform, Bovada Casino embraces cryptocurrencies as a payment option. Players can use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Tether to make deposits and withdrawals. With cryptocurrencies, players enjoy low minimum deposit amounts of 10, quicker processing, and affordable transactions. To use a bonus code at Bovada Casino, you will need to enter it during the deposit process. After logging into your Bovada account, head to the Cashier section and select your preferred deposit method. During this process, you will see a designated field where you can enter the relevant bonus code. Ensure you input the correct code before confirming your deposit to activate the associated bonus successfully. To qualify for Bovadas bonus offers, players must be at least 18 years old. However, since gambling laws vary between regions, you must check your local regulations to ensure you meet the legal age requirements in your area before signing up and claiming any bonuses.",0
"Title: Vegas Casino Online Review - Enjoy A 3,000 Welcome Bonus!
Description: To help get started, weve reviewed some of the top operators in the industry. Vegas Casino Online is a UK-based casino established in 2011 and is owned
Content: Home  Vegas Casino Online Review Modified April 24, 2025 - Dustin Williams Check out our comprehensive review of Vegas Casino Online below. They are one of a number of top offshore casino sites that can be accessed by players in the United States. Since the early 2000s, interest in online casinos has skyrocketed and now there is a sea of options waiting to greet eager players. A list of endless options sounds good at first but its easy for gamblers, especially those new to the entertainment sector, to feel overwhelmed. To help get started, weve reviewed some of the top operators in the industry. Vegas Casino Online is a UK-based casino established in 2011 and is owned by Main Street Vegas Group Casinos. We have examined everything from the welcome offers on the table to the detailed terms and conditions. When you sign up, Vegas Casino Online offers a casino welcome bonus of 300 up to 3000 on your first deposit. When making your first deposit, you need to enter the promo code to claim the bonus. The minimum deposit required to qualify for the welcome bonus is 25, but you can deposit up to 1000 to receive the maximum deposit bonus. The deposit and bonus must be wagered 45x, meaning that it ends up being relatively high, as it could also be seen as 90x the deposit amount. Certain games do not contribute towards the wagering requirements, like live dealer games, etc. However, some, like slots, contribute 1 for every spinbet, while poker games contribute 0.50 for every 1 bet. Its essential to make sure you know which games contribute to fulfilling the wagering requirements. While there is no expiry period stated, there is a maximum winnings cap of 10,000. Promo codes offer you the chance to claim time-limited bonuses or specific promotions from a website. Vegas Casino Online provides several promo codes that you can redeem. You must enter these promo codes before depositing in order to claim the bonus. The welcome bonus up to 300 code is VEGASPLAY. There is a 150 deposit bonus with two bonus codes, they are IDBSLOTS and 150BONUS. There is also a blackjack promo code BJMATCH that awards a bonus of 100 for blackjack games and a special reload bonus of 200 with the promo code VEGAS200. Other promo codes are given periodically in time-limited bonuses, like seasonal or weekly bonuses. This includes time-limited promo codes like the winter seasonal promo code of WINTERLUCK or the new game promotion using promo code EMERALD. Vegas Casino Online doesnt offer a no deposit casino welcome bonus, but we found it does offer a verification no deposit bonus. In order to qualify for this bonus, you must be an active player of good standing for at least three months and have deposited via card at least once. If you fulfill these requirements, you can verify your account by sending the casino your copy of ID, proof of billing address, credit card agreement form which they provide a link to and clear copies of all the credit cards youve used at the casino. You can either email the documents to email protected or fax them to 1-888-673-2523, a toll-free number in the US. Once youve been verified, youll receive a 20 bonus, with a max cash out of 5000 for all winnings won from this bonus. Casino free spins are almost as popular as no deposit bonuses, as they allow players to try out new slots for free. This is especially helpful if youre new to gaming or a newly released slot. This also holds true for Vegas Casino Online, as they have a new game bonus EMERALD where they offer a 200 bonus, as well as ten free spins and a 25 free chip on the Thai Emerald slot. Unfortunately, we didnt find any other dedicated free spins bonuses at Vegas Casino Online. They might offer some weekly or seasonal promotions, but they do not have a permanent free spins bonus. We found several other deposit bonuses at Vegas Casino Online  The 200 double match bonus of up to 2000. It has a minimum deposit of 25 and a 40x wagering requirement of your deposit plus bonus. It can only be used in slots or keno, with other games and progressive slots excluded.  There is also a 150 deposit bonus of up to 3000, with a minimum deposit of 25. The wagering requirement for your deposit plus bonus is 40x unless youre playing video poker or multi-hand video poker. Then the wagering requirement is 90x your deposit plus bonus. There are some excluded games, like live dealer games.  We also found a Monday cashback bonus, where you receive 20 of all your deposits made on Monday between 0000 am and 1159 pm CST. The cashback does not have any wagering requirements and has withdrawal limits of 150 to 1000.  A referral bonus is also provided at Vegas Casino Online. You can refer as many friends as you want and each friend that signs up and makes a 50 deposit awards you with 20 free bonus cash. The referred friend has to email support with your username and your account will be credited with the bonus cash. The 20 bonus cash has to be wagered 40x before you can withdraw it or any winnings.  We also found that they offer a weekly prize bonus where ten players receive a 100 cash prize. There are no terms stating what you need to do to become eligible for this bonus, just that you can contact support to find out more about it. The winners are announced in the weekly newsletter.  Other than that, we found mention of monthly, seasonal, birthday, and anniversary. While we didnt find a progressive VIP casino program, a loyalty program is offered. When you make real money wagers, you earn points that you can redeem for cash. The loyalty program will take the points that youve redeemed in the previous month to reward you with one of three ranks. The cash you redeemed will be tallied up to give you a rank of either Silver, Gold, or Platinum. If you redeem between 200 and 499, you achieve the Silver rank and receive bonus cash of 25 with 12x wagering requirements. Between 500 and 999 will give you the Gold level and 50 bonus cash with 15x wagering requirements. To reach the Platinum rank, you must redeem more than 1000 worth of comp points and will receive 75 bonus cash with 18x wagering requirements. Vegas Casino Online uses RealTime Gaming RTG software to run its gaming platform and offers over 100 titles from the supplier. You can choose from 3-reel, 5-reel, and 6-reel slots, as well as progressive, pays any, and floating symbols slots. There are many online slots featuring bonus rounds and you can always see whats new by clicking on the new games tab. Popular slots like Asgard Deluxe, Cleopatras Gold, Bubble Bubble, and Big Santa are all available to you. However, there isnt a favorite or featured Slots tab that makes accessing them more manageable. Vegas Casino Online also offers these slots in demo mode, allowing you to try the games before wagering any real money. While they offer other casino games, like table games, specialty games, etc., we found the selection extremely limited. There are under 30 casino games available overall, with eight table games, 14 Video poker games and four specialty games like keno, board games, roulette, and shooting games. We couldnt find any scratch cards available on their website, nor any bingo or lottery games. There are three blackjack games, three poker games and two casino Holdem games, with no craps or baccarat offered when it comes to table games. The single roulette game provided can be found under the specialties tab. Live dealer games are an exciting part of any online casino, as you can experience the true thrill of iGaming with it. While in the comfort of your own space, you can still interact with other gamers and a live dealer when playing table games like baccarat, blackjack, poker, roulette and craps. We didnt find a live casino section at Vegas Casino Online and it seems like live dealer games are unfortunately not offered. We found the web-based, mobile casino to offer an equal experience to the desktop casino, but accessing the instant play casino through mobile is infinitely more complicated than using your desktop. We eventually had to type in the direct URL of the instant play site to access it instead of following a link from their official page. The casino also offers quick access software that can be downloaded to your iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac device, allowing you to access the casino easily. However, there isnt an app available on the App Store or Google Play Store. While we found the casino to provide a variety of banking methods, including Neteller, Paysafe and Qiwi, there are only specific payment methods available to US citizens. The deposit methods available are cards, namely Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express, as well as Bitcoin. The deposit limits are 25 to 500 per transaction, with maximum deposit limits of 30,000day or week for cards. Bitcoin has deposit limits of 20 to 50,000 overall. Unfortunately, Vegas Casino Online is not a PayPal Casino site for those who are interested in using that payment service. The only withdrawal methods available are Bank transfers, Bitcoin, and Check by Courier or Mail. All four methods have no transaction fee attached. While we couldnt find the payout speeds mentioned, we did find the withdrawal limits. Bank transfers allow withdrawals between 150 and 2500 per transaction, with Bitcoin between 150 and 1000. Check by Courier is between 400 and 2500 and check by mail is between 150 and 390. Looking at the support channels offered, it seems to provide everything you could need. There is a 247 live chat, as well as a support email email protected where a support agent will respond within 24 hours, according to the website. They, unfortunately, dont offer a phone line for you to call them with, as the only number provided is a fax line. However, we saw that though the live chat is stated to be available 247, it was unavailable when we looked at it, with a message saying no support agents are available at that time. Instead, you have to fill in a contact form and wait for the support team to contact you through email. Having looked at the various aspects of Vegas Casino Online, we found some positives and drawbacks to playing at the casino. While there are many bonuses and promo codes you can take advantage of, the wagering requirements are pretty high, as is the minimum deposit needed to claim the bonus. There is no VIP program or high-roller bonuses available and while there is a loyalty program, its not the best one weve seen. The no deposit bonus, referral bonus, and weekly cash prizes are appreciated, though. While we found that several top RTG slot titles are available, its still less than most online casinos, with their other casino games extremely limited. Wed appreciate it if they offered live casino games as well, along with more varieties of table games, bingo, and scratch cards. Further, there are minimal banking options, with a high minimum withdrawal amount and a low maximum withdrawal. While no fees are charged, this section could still be improved. We appreciate the quick access software the casino offers but wish they would give easier access on mobile. The support could be better, with live chat actually being available 247 as they claim it is and a phone number provided. While the casino doesnt use a testing agency itself, all RGT games are tested for fairness by CDS Central Disputes System Certified. The gaming platform itself is user-friendly and the bonuses are plenty, we still recommend that you take care before registering at Vegas Casino Online.",0
"Title: Drake Places 200K Bet On Golden State Warriors With Stake - YourNewsWire
Description: Global music star Drake has been extremely active in sports betting since signing a multi-year deal with Stake.com earlier this year.
Content: Home  General News Drake Places 200K Bet On Golden State Warriors With Stake Global music star Drake has been extremely active in sports betting since signing a multi-year deal with Stake.com earlier this year. The rapper has been using the best offshore sports books platform exclusively to place his wagers, then posting them on his social media platforms such as Instagram. He first caught the headlines with a Super Bowl bet that he placed using Stake, with his three separate wagers totaling 1.26 million and resulting in a mighty payout of 2.27 million. He is now back with his latest big money wager, this time turning his attention to NBA betting after the Playoffs began earlier this month. The 35-year-old has wagered 200,000 on the Golden State Warriors to win the Western Conference at 500 odds, giving him a potential payout of 1 million. The Warriors have made an excellent start to the postseason too, taking a 3-1 lead over the Denver Nuggets in their First Round series ahead of Game 5 at home on Wednesday night. Steve Kerrs team wouldve completed a sweep in Game 4 had it not been for a 37-point performance from MVP Nikola Jokic. Should they get the job done, they would then face the winners of the Memphis Grizzlies-Minnesota Timberwolves series which is intriguingly poised at 2-2. The performances of Jordan Poole, Klay Thompson, Steph Curry and Draymond Green arent the only reasons for encouragement, either. Golden States biggest foe in the west, the Phoenix Suns, are currently tied 2-2 with the New Orleans Pelicans and are currently without All-Star guard Devin Booker, who is struggling with a hamstring injury. They would certainly be the biggest threat to Drakes 1 million prize given their dominant performances throughout the regular season, finishing with an impressive 64-18 record. The two teams split the regular season series 2-2, indicating that this could be a series that goes all the way to a Game 7. The health of Booker for the remainder of the Playoffs could be a critical factor in the Western Conference landscape and Suns coach Monty Williams will be hesitant to rush him back too soon and inflict further damage. However, a defeat in Game 5 could leave them with no choice but to bring him back into the fold sooner than expected. Drake, like all other Stake users, has placed his wagers using cryptocurrencies. Stake is one of the biggest Bitcoin betting sites available and new users can have the chance to win a 50,000 giveaway every week on the site.",0

To play a casino game or bet on your favorite sport, you have to get in your car and drive a distance to one of these land-based casinos. There are licensed online casinos in six states of the US. The problem is that they do not allow North Dakota residents to play on their online platforms. The law in North Dakota, however, doesnt mention offshore online casinos. That means that the state of North Dakota can not prosecute its residents if they participate in an offshore casino. Offshore casinos are the same as onshore casinos. The only difference is that their operating head office is registered in a country outside of the US. That countrys laws and regulations govern offshore casinos. They usually hold an online gambling license issued by that country. The best North Dakota offshore casinos offer real money excitement without having to leave your home. So if you live in North Dakota, you are invited to relax and play your favorite casino game or wager on your basketball team in the comfort of your own home.

Although these bonuses offered by online casinos are very tempting, its not the only criteria that you must take into consideration. If we are living in North Dakota and are new to the online gaming industry, it is important not to just join up with the first site that appears on our search. There are a lot of reasons, besides the enticing bonuses, why we should join a particular casino We must consider factors like which country they operate from and if these online casinos are licensed. This is important because we want to play in a casino registered in a country with a respected regulator. The casino must also allow residents from North Dakota to register and play on their site. It is also essential to check how long they have provided online gambling services. In the competitive online gaming world, mediocre and untrustworthy sites do not stay on the scene for a long time. If the casino we fancy has been providing online gaming for a few years, they are doing their business correctly. It is essential to be able to deposit money quickly and securely and to be able to withdraw our winnings when we want to.

We must also make sure that we understand their fee structure for withdrawals. Some online casinos also accept cryptocurrency as a method to make deposit payments. The casinos charge different rates. The top sites will have an information page to inform us how a cryptocurrency payment, such as Bitcoin, will work. Make sure that the casino we select has a good variety of excellent quality casino games or sports betting on offer. Some sites also have live online table games if we want a more interactive game.

Knowing the minimum and maximum bets is especially important for our table games like blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. Sometimes the minimum bet can be too high for us, limiting us to a few rounds.

We want to play on a site that is easy to navigate from one game to the other. Software interfaces can make or break our playing experience.

"Title: U.S. Congress to Vote on Bill Criminalizing Boycotts of Israel as Houthis Bomb Tel Aviv Airport
Description: The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on H.R. 867 tomorrow, Monday, May 5, 2025. H.R. 867 is known as the IGO Anti-Boycott Act. This bill seeks to expand existing anti-boycott laws to penalize Americans who participate in boycotts of Israel or Israeli settlements that are promoted by international governmental organizations such as the United Nations or the European Union. If passed, the legislation would impose civil penalties of up to 300,000, with criminal fines reaching 1 million and prison sentences of up to 20 years for individuals supporting such boycotts. The bill is sponsored by pro-Israel Congressmen Mike Lawler and Josh Gottheimer. This bill is scheduled to be considered under suspension of the Rules of the House of Representatives during the week of May 5, 2025. Under suspension, floor debate is limited, all floor amendments are prohibited, points of order against the bill are waived, and final passage requires a two-thirds majority vote.

Other headline news from our Telegram Channel today. From The Times of Israel A ballistic missile fired by the Houthis in Yemen impacted on the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport on Sunday morning, injuring six people, none of them seriously. The military said it made several attempts to intercept the missile but failed to shoot down the projectile. An impact was identified in the area of Ben Gurion Airport, it said. The attack marked the first time a Houthi missile had impacted within the grounds of the airport. Sirens sounded across central Israel at 922 a.m. Preceding the sirens by some five minutes, an early warning was issued to residents, alerting civilians of the long-range missile attack via a push notification on their phones. By late afternoon, most foreign airlines had suspended services. Source. The U.S. government is keeping American casualty numbers for the undeclared war on Yemen secret. This is not normal. From The Intercept The Trump administration is fighting an undeclared war in Yemen, and it has not been shy about publicizing the details of its attacks. But the administration is unwilling to level with the American people about the costs of war. U.S. Central Command, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the White House are keeping the number of U.S. casualties from this ongoing conflict secret. This amounts to a cover-up. Members of Congress are calling for accountability. The administration should be transparent about the number of U.S. casualties from the attacks on the Houthis, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told The Intercept. I am also working to hold the administration accountable for its unauthorized strikes in Yemen. After two decades of intermittent war in Yemen, the U.S. officially launched Operation Rough Rider in March of this year, and has carried out strikes on more than 1,000 targets in Yemen. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has also ramped up conflicts in Iraq, Somalia, and Syria, after running as an anti-war candidate and pitching himself as a peacemaker. Recent U.S. attacks in response have targeted civilian infrastructure and, according to local reports, killed scores of innocent people. U.S. troops are also in harms way. Earlier this week, a fighter jet fell off the side of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, the Navy said in a statement on Monday. The Truman reportedly made a sharp turn to evade a Houthi attack, which caused the U.S. Navy FA-18 Super Hornet fighter to plunge overboard. One sailor was injured in the chaos, and the 60 million plane was lost to the deep. This was a tragic accident, and lets be clear  neither this service member, nor any of the other service members in Yemen, should have ever been in harms way, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told The Intercept. Trumps strikes in Yemen are unconstitutional and Congress must assert its congressional war powers before another service member is injured in the line of duty. How many other military personnel have been killed or wounded in the broader U.S. campaign against the Houthis, which began under the Biden administration, is being withheld from the American public. Source. Trump is LYING, again, when he says wed have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials for his reason for not allowing due process of law for those he is deporting, many of whom are here LEGALLY with student visas, or are even permanent residents with Green Cards. His own administration claims they have only deported about 65,000 people in his first 100 days, and some immigration officials even question that number, but it is about the same as Joe Biden deported in his first 100 days. What does this communicate to people in the U.S. and around the world when the President of the United States says he doesnt know if he has to obey the Constitution? From NBC News Trump said on NBC News Meet the Press that hes following lawyers advice as he tries to execute rapid deportations, arguing that giving immigrants due process is time-consuming. President Donald Trump argued in an interview with NBC News Meet the Press that fulfilling his ambitious campaign promise to rapidly carry out mass deportations may take precedence over giving immigrants the right to due process under the Constitution, as required by courts. In an interview last month with Meet the Press, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, Yes, of course, when asked whether every person in the United States is entitled to due process. Trump, however, isnt so sure. I dont know. Im not, Im not a lawyer. I dont know, Trump replied when asked by Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker whether he agreed with Rubio. His comments came during a wide-ranging interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which aired Sunday. The Constitutions Fifth Amendment says no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law it does not say that person must be a U.S. citizen, and the Supreme Court has long recognized that noncitizens have certain basic rights. Trump has also said that while we always have to obey the laws, he would like to see some homegrown criminals sent to El Salvador as well, a proposal that was widely panned by legal experts. When Welker tried to point out what the Fifth Amendment said, Trump suggested that such a process would slow him down too much. I dont know. It seems  it might say that, but if youre talking about that, then wed have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials, he said. We have thousands of people that are  some murderers and some drug dealers and some of the worst people on Earth. I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it, he added. But even given those numbers that youre talking about, dont you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president? Welker asked. I dont know, Trump replied. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. The Supreme Court has already made it clear to the Trump administration in three different recent decisions that it has to allow basic due process rights for immigrants based on the long-standing understanding of the laws. That would not require full trials, as Trump suggested. What it would require is the chance to appear before an immigration judge. Such judges are not part of the judicial branch they are employees of the Justice Department. Administration officials have spoken out against such constraints, leading to allegations that they have defied instructions from lower court judges and even the Supreme Court. Source. From Sherwood News Retailers are scrambling to rethink sourcing, pricing, and survival strategies as tariffs kick in. About 97 of the clothes and shoes sold in the US are imported, with China being the largest source. Analysts expect retailers to get hit hard by tariffs, with rising costs and shrinking margins forcing them to raise prices as consumers are already tightening their belts. So far Nike saw more than 12 billion in market value swoosh away as investors fretted over the sneaker giants inventory pileups and tariffs hitting its key manufacturing hubs in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Levis tried to downplay tariff troubles, as most of the denim giants spring and summer products are already in the US, limiting near-term margin pressure. But the supply chain of those American jeans involves Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and of course China. Source. From baby gear to power tools, these brands are announcing price hikes as tariffs take effect. From Eat This Not That 1. Stanley Black  Decker Stanley Black  Decker says price hikes are coming as a result of the tariffs. In light of the current environment, we are accelerating adjustments to our supply chain and exploring all options as we seek to minimize the impact of tariffs on end users while balancing the need to protect our business and our ability to innovate for years to come, said CEO Donald Allan. 2. Procter  Gamble Procter  Gamble says price hikes are likely as a result of the tariffs. There will likely be pricing  tariffs are inherently inflationary  but were also looking at sourcing options, PG CEO Jon Moeller said on CNBCs Squawk Box. The brand owns Tide and Charmin, which could become more expensive. 3. Hasbro Toys Toy company Hasbro manufactures a significant amount of merchandise in China, and says prices will likely go up as a result of the tariffs. 4. Zwilling J.A. Henckels German kitchenware company Zwilling J.A. Henckels makes some of its knives in China, which is being hit with 145 tariffs. This means the company will have to raise prices starting around June. We dont want to increase prices, chief sales and marketing officer Joanna Rosenberg told The New York Times. Theres just no way that we can absorb some of these price increases. 5. UPPABaby Upscale baby gear company UPPAbaby, known for their exceptional baby seats and strollers, will be raising prices as a result of tariffs. Please know that weve made every effort behind the scenes to absorb as much of the cost as possible, but some price increases are unfortunately unavoidable, the company says. 6.

A very good investigative report by The Guardian on what awaits LA ports starting this week, and how it will affect the entire country. Excerpts Southern California may be known for celebrities and glitz, but the true action has long been about 40 miles away from Hollywood, in a place where high-visibility coveralls and hardhats dominate. For the past 25 years, the San Pedro Bay port complex  comprised of the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach  has been the celebrity of the shipping world and an economic driver of Californias massive economy. The busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world, approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock, moving billions of dollars worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts, toys, clothes and furniture. This week, however, the port is shining a little less brightly. As a result of the Trump administrations decision to subject imports to a minimum 10 tariff and levies far higher for goods from 57 countries, roughly a third of the traffic at the port has ground to a halt, according to Eugene Seroka, the chief executive officer of the Port of Los Angeles. With more than 70 of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LAs waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union ILWU local 13. One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports  warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more, said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LAs Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. What happens in the port doesnt stay in the port, echoed long-time labor activist and former Los Angeles harbor commissioner Diane Middleton. One way or the other, cargo that comes in here goes to all 435 US congressional districts. Everyone in the US will feel this. Source. Unable to defeat the Yemen Houthis, Israel and the U.S. are increasing their threats against Iran instead now. Iran responded just a little while ago. From The Times of Israel More from Irans Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh Nasirzadeh says Tehran will strike back if the United States or Israel attacks. His comments come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate against Iran for the Tehran-backed Houthi group firing a missile that landed near Israels main airport. If this war is initiated by the US or the Zionist regime, Iran will target their interests, bases and forces  wherever they may be and whenever deemed necessary, Nasirzadeh tells Iranian state TV. Echoing Irans official stance, Nasirzadeh says the Houthis act upon their own motivations. Source.

"Title: The End of the First Amendment  Only Zionist Jewish Voices Allowed on U.S. Campuses
Description: There is a new pandemic sweeping across the U.S., and President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order to prevent it from spreading through college and university campuses, by creating a Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. And who better to lead this new fight against this deadly pandemic, than the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a Press Release yesterday, Secretary Kennedy stated that antisemitism was a deadly and virulent pestilence that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to historys most deadly plagues. Well, that sure gives Make America Healthy Again MAHA a whole new meaning, doesnt it? I wonder if Secretary Robert F.

And who better to lead this new fight against this deadly pandemic, than the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. U.S. Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. raised eyebrows on Monday after he announced a Health Department mission to end anti-semitic harassment on college campuses. Anti-Semitism  like racism  is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to historys most deadly plagues, wrote Kennedy in an announcement on Monday evening, adding In recent years, the censorship and false narratives of woke cancel culture have transformed our great universities into greenhouses for this deadly and virulent pestilence. Making America healthy means building communities of trust and mutual respect, based on speech freedom and open debate. Kennedy then linked to a press release announcing a joint-effort by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the General Services Administration to end anti-semitic harassment on college campuses, beginning with a comprehensive review of Columbia Universitys federal contracts and grants in light of ongoing investigations for potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Source. Here is the Press Release WASHINGTON  Today, the Department of Health and Human Services HHS, Department of Education ED, and the U.S. General Services Administration GSA announced a comprehensive review of Columbia Universitys federal contracts and grants in light of ongoing investigations for potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Given Columbias ongoing inaction in the face of relentless harassment of Jewish students, the Federal Governments Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism is considering Stop Work Orders for 51.4 million in contracts between Columbia University and the Federal Government. The task force will also conduct a comprehensive review of the more than 5 billion in federal grant commitments to Columbia University to ensure the university is in compliance with federal regulations, including its civil rights responsibilities. Anti-Semitism  like racism  is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to historys most deadly plagues, said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. In recent years, the censorship and false narratives of woke cancel culture have transformed our great universities into greenhouses for this deadly and virulent pestilence. Making America healthy means building communities of trust and mutual respect, based on speech freedom and open debate. The Task Forces review is the first major action announced from the multi-agency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism created by President Trumps Executive Order titled Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism.

Kennedy Jr. is developing antisemitic vaccines yet, since he has been telling the whole world lately how much he loves vaccines? Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is also on the record for stating that antisemitism is a virus that is spreading quickly through the campuses of Americas colleges and universities. President Donald Trump called student protests at Americas colleges and universities illegal, without citing any laws they were breaking, because there are none  only his own executive orders. The law that actually applies to protests on campuses is called The First Amendment, which is part of the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution, and protects Freedom of Speech as well as Freedom of Religion. All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests, Trump wrote in a social media post, adding that students may be expelled, arrested or deported President Donald Trump is threatening to punish student protesters  and schools that allow illegal protests to unfold without repercussions. On Tuesday, March 4, the politician said that he will expel and potentially imprison or deport students who participate in certain protests via a heated message on Truth Social. All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests, Trump wrote on his social media website. Agitators will be imprisonedor permanently sent back to the country from which they came. He continued American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter. The right to protest in most public spaces is protected by the First Amendment. Trump did not specify what makes a protest illegal in his eyes, though his note about masks suggests that, at a minimum, he would target people who wear face-covering masks to protests. Source. Imagine that! In 2020 during Trumps last year in office, most colleges and universities did not allow students on campus unless they wore masks and provided proof of being vaccinated against COVID-19, but here in 2025 with the new Antisemitism Virus spreading, wearing masks is prohibited! The statement in Secretary Kennedys Press Release that is the most concerning to me, is that this is the first major action announced from the multi-agency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. What other actions may be in the pipeline by this Task Force to combat this deadly plague of antisemitism that RFK, Jr. says threatens our country? It is already illegal to do business in 38 States for any business that opposes the Zionist agenda and does not give unconditional support to Israel. See The U.S. and Israel appear to be on the brink of war in the Middle East, with certain Arab nations, such as Egypt and Yemen, reportedly preparing for war to prevent Donald Trump from purchasing Gaza and displacing the Palestinian people. Could we soon see these Task Forces become armed, and start visiting churches, synagogues, and mosques in the U.S. who dont comply with this Antisemitism Executive Order? Will everyone eventually be required to wear a Star of David on their body somewhere to prove they are not infected with the deadly antisemitism virus?

Kennedy Jr., has just published a notice threatening U.S. scientists and medical researchers funded by NIH with losing their funding if they criticize Israel. Lee Fang covered this on his Substack Page NIH promised an era of free speech and free expression. New rules attempt to chill speech related to Israel. Research institutes and universities may engage in boycotts or divestment to pressure any country or government entity in the world. Recent institutional boycotts include measures to protest corporations that do business in North Carolina and China. That right no longer exists when it comes to protests of Israel. Researchers and university employees who engage in certain nonviolent protests or political expression over human rights conditions in Israel may risk civil and criminal penalties, according to a new policy unveiled by the National Institutes of Health yesterday. The agency, the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, touches virtually every corner of the scientific community. The blanket boycott suppression is a radical expansion of so-called anti-BDS rules that restrict Americans from boycotting or simply advocating divestment from Israel-related businesses. The new NIH policy, which mirrors anti-BDS laws applied to contractors in thirty eight states, now silences hundreds of thousands of researchers. It applies to all domestic recipients of new, renewal, supplement, or continuation awards issued starting April 21. Full article. MAHA!

"Title: ICE Kidnaps Permanent Resident in U.S. for 10 Years on His Way to an Interview to Become a U.S. Citizen  No Warrant, No Criminal Record, No Charges, and Nobody Knows Where He Is
Description: ICE agents seized a Palestinian student this week, Mohsen Mahdawi, who was a legal permanent resident holding a Green Card, and who had been in the U.S. legally for 10 years. Ironically, he was attending an immigration interview to become a U.S. Citizen in Vermont, something he would not have been able to do if he were here illegally, and if he had not already have resided in the U.S. for many years with no criminal record, in order to earn this interview to become a U.S. Citizen. Like previous students before him, he was approached by masked men, with reportedly no warrant, handcuffed and taken away, and at the time of this writing, nobody knows where he is, not even his lawyers whom he apparently was not allowed to call. As I wrote yesterday, President Trump has stated he wants to be able to deport U.S. Citizens that his administration declares are criminals. I actually expected some kind of retraction or clarification from his administration today, since Trump has a habit of going off script and saying embarrassing things that later need to be clarified. Surely the thought of deporting U.S. Citizens to one of the most barbaric and famous prisons in the world in El Salvador, would be one of those cases, I thought. But no, the White House announced today that this is actually true. What we are now observing in real time here in the U.S. is Trumps Zionist Administration trying to abolish the Constitution of the United States, and turning this country into a Zionist Jewish Monarchy instead, giving Trump powers outside the legal bounds of U.S. law, and even exploring ways to keep him in power beyond his current term.
Content: Mohsen Mahdawi appeared on 60 Minutes in December of 2023 where he condemned antisemitism. by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News ICE agents seized a Palestinian student this week, Mohsen Mahdawi, who was a legal permanent resident holding a Green Card, and who had been in the U.S. legally for 10 years. Ironically, he was attending an immigration interview to become a U.S. Citizen in Vermont, something he would not have been able to do if he were here illegally, and if he had not already have resided in the U.S. for many years with no criminal record, in order to earn this interview to become a U.S. Citizen. Like previous students before him, he was approached by masked men, with reportedly no warrant, handcuffed and taken away, and at the time of this writing, nobody knows where he is, not even his lawyers whom he apparently was not allowed to call. Here is a 3-minute report from CBS in New York Because Mohsen Mahdawi was a leader of a pro-Palestinian group at Columbia University, the New York Times is reporting that Mahdawi is being deported because his activities could potentially undermine the Middle East peace process, according to a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Trump administration is seeking to deport a Columbia student because his activities could potentially undermine the Middle East peace process, according to a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that was reviewed by The New York Times. The memo asserted, without elaboration, that protests of the type Mr. Mahdawi had led could undermine the Middle East peace process by reinforcing antisemitic sentiment in the region and around the world and ultimately threatening a U.S. foreign policy goal of resolving the Gaza conflict peacefully. It also said, without elaborating, that Mr. Mahdawi had engaged in threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders and that his actions had undermined efforts to protect Jewish students from violence. A lawyer for Mr. Mahdawi, Luna Droubi, asked to comment on the assertions in the memo, said that they were baseless claims made with no evidence. Mohsen in fact took the lead on bringing Palestinian and Israeli students together in pursuit of a just peace on campus and in the Middle East, she said. Mohsen, like every other person in this country, is entitled to due process and protections under the First Amendment. Source. These kinds of lies from the Trump administration are becoming quite frequent, especially when they claim these Palestinian protesters are threatening Jewish students, when in fact Jewish students and other Jews are protesting against these illegal kidnappings. This is from the Israeli publication Haaretz Despite leading the Columbias Gaza solidarity encampment, Mohsen Mahdawi spent months fostering ties with Israeli and Jewish students, even holding meetings with university administrators to promote dialogue. Roni Ziv, an Israeli student who met with Mahdawi, says the Trump administration will come for everyone. Source. As I wrote yesterday, President Trump has stated he wants to be able to deport U.S. Citizens that his administration declares are criminals. I actually expected some kind of retraction or clarification from his administration today, since Trump has a habit of going off script and saying embarrassing things that later need to be clarified. Surely the thought of deporting U.S. Citizens to one of the most barbaric and famous prisons in the world in El Salvador, would be one of those cases, I thought. But no, the White House announced today that this is actually true. President Donald Trump is exploring whether he can legally deport U.S. citizens to prisons in Central American countries, the White House said Tuesday. Its another question that the president has raised, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said when a reporter asked if Trump currently has the power to send Americans to foreign prisons or would need to change the law to do so. Its a legal question that the president is looking into, Leavitt answered. Source. Of course there are no laws that would allow ICE agents to start pulling U.S. Citizens off the street, and then immediately fly them to a prison in El Salvador with no due process of law. The Trump Administration obviously knows this. So the only way this could happen is the same way they are doing it right now with the students, by issuing an Executive Order, probably by declaring some kind of emergency to give Trump emergency powers, which is what he did in 2020 with COVID and the COVID injections, and is what he is doing right now with his tariffs and his antisemitism task force. Image source and article. What we are now observing in real time here in the U.S. is Trumps Zionist Administration trying to abolish the Constitution of the United States, and turning this country into a Zionist Jewish Monarchy instead, giving Trump powers outside the legal bounds of U.S. law, and even exploring ways to keep him in power beyond his current term. They are already clearly disregarding an order from the U.S. Supreme Court, and challenging the legitimacy of the U.S. legal system. The DOJ and the attorneys of the Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to the prison in El Salvador were back before a federal judge today, where the judge is beginning the discovery process to find out if the Trump Administration is guilty of being in contempt of court. A federal judge rebuked the Trump administration for doing nothing to arrange the return a Maryland man who was wrongly flown to a prison in El Salvador last month, and in a hearing on Tuesday set in motion a process to determine if the Trump administration officials had defied court orders requiring the government to bring the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, back to the United States. The case has set up what could be a constitutional showdown between the White House and the judicial branch. The administration has argued that federal judges have no authority to tell the White House how to conduct foreign policy. Forcing the administration to reveal what it has done behind the scenes is an interim step on the way toward Judge Xinis figuring out if officials are in contempt of court. The judge also notes that this could be an uncomfortable process as the administration is compelled to answer specific questions and officials are possibly made to sit for depositions. She says she envisions the discovery process taking about two weeks. Suggesting how expeditiously she intends to move, Judge Xinis tells Drew Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, that he should clear his calendar in order to arrange the discovery information she intends to request. Cancel vacation, she says. Cancel other appointments. Im usually pretty good about this in my courtroom, but not this time. Laying out what she describes as a tight timeline, Judge Xinis asked Abrego Garcias lawyers to get their questions for the government ready by tomorrow. She says the plaintiffs can submit up to 15 questions and 15 requests for documents. The judge also says the plaintiffs can depose up to six administration officials, naming a few of them Robert Cerna, a top official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Joseph Mazzara, the acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security. Source. The Trump Administration is claiming that they are powerless to bring this man back to the U.S., but the New York Times has reported that Trump has already done this before, in 2018 during his first term, where an Iraqi man was wrongly deported. In August 2018, during President Trumps first term, an Iraqi immigrant named Muneer Subaihani went missing. A refugee who had been living in the United States for nearly 25 years, Mr. Subaihani was among hundreds of Iraqis who had been protected from deportation under a federal court order. His lawyers figured he was still in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where he had been placed after he was swept up in an ICE raid. A search of the federal ICE database turned up nothing, so the attorneys went to the Justice Department, looking for an answer. Within a day, they got one. The government said it had made a mistake, according to Margo Schlanger, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School who was one of Mr. Subaihanis lawyers. Mr. Subaihani had been deported to Iraq, in violation of the court order. The case has striking similarities to one that is playing out now in Mr. Trumps second term, after the United States deported a Salvadoran man because of what the government has acknowledged was an administrative error. But the Trump administrations response in the two cases could not be more different, a sign of how emboldened Mr. Trump has become in his defiance of the courts and in his determination to take a hard line on deportations, regardless of legal constraints. In Mr. Subaihanis case, the government recognized its error to the federal court, setting off a monthslong odyssey to track down and retrieve a man who never should have been deported in the first place. Source. As I have previously written just before Trump took his oath to office for his second term, where he did NOT put his hand on the Bible, I fasted and prayed for 10 days to seek Gods wisdom as to just what my role should be in Trump 2.0. I am repeating that here, because I have received emails from people demanding that I stop criticizing Trump, or complaining that I now cover politics too much. This is the verse the Lord spoke to me through at the beginning of this year 2025 John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brothers wife, and all the other evil things he had done. Luke 319 Read my first article published under Trump 2.0 Excerpt God has given me clear guidance in a couple of different ways, and one of those was in my recent study of the Gospel of Luke, and the account of the ministry of John the Baptist, who was the cousin of Jesus Christ, and whom Jesus testified was the last of the line of Old Testament prophets, and the greatest man to have walked the earth. The ruling religious leaders of Johns day were the members of the Sanhedrin, but the political leader was Herod, and John was led by the Holy Spirit to reveal the sins of this political leader of the Jews to the public as a warning. The result was that John was put in prison, and eventually beheaded, but his mission was already complete, which was to prepare The Way of Jesus Christ, the Jewish Messiah, which he did. The great news about the New Covenant, is that any believer in Jesus Christ filled with his Holy Spirit can now prophesy and testify to the truth. However, the consequences of doing so remain the same, and if Zionism spreads unchecked, I fear that what we saw during COVID in Trump 1.0 will pale in comparison to what might be about to happen in Trump 2.0. Full article. So just as John the Baptist, who prepared The Way of Jesus Christ to fulfill his ministry in the First Century, and was also called upon by God to expose the sins of the government of his day, so too is the Holy Spirit leading me to expose the dangers and sins of Trump 2.0. Therefore, to every one of my critics and enemies who email me demanding that I stop criticizing Donald Trump so much, I have to choose between obeying you, or obeying God, and that choice is easy for me. And if you live in the United States of America and believe that you can avoid making a similar choice about Trump and his Zionist goals, you are gravely mistaken. Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven. Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law a mans enemies will be the members of his own household.

"Title: How Trump is Restoring Zionist Groups to the Most Powerful Lobby in the United States  The Antichrists in Trumps Administration and Probably in Your Family as Well
Description: As most of the world has been focused on President Trumps economic policies and tariffs this past week, he continued to forge ahead to fulfill his campaign promise to restore the Zionist lobby in the U.S. as the most powerful lobby in the U.S. by far. This week Trump announced he was nominating Israeli-born Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi Yehuda Kaploun as US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. Max Blumenthal of The Gray Zone also published a leaked audio from a meeting with the CEO of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC, where they boasted that they had special access to the top National Security officials in the Trump Administration, including John Ratcliffe whom they helped in securing the position of head of the CIA. The U.S. is now clearly led by antichrists, and there is a good chance that you also deal with antichrists in your own family and community, especially if they call you antisemitic because you believe that Jesus Christ is the Jewish Messiah who fulfilled all the Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah. How can we identify these antichrists and false prophets?
Content: by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News As most of the world has been focused on President Trumps economic policies and tariffs this past week, he continued to forge ahead to fulfill his campaign promise to restore the Zionist lobby in the U.S. as the most powerful lobby in the U.S. by far. Here is a recording of Trumps campaign promise in 2024 to restore the Zionist lobby for Israel as the most powerful lobby in the U.S. by far. Notice how he distinguishes between Zionist Jews and non-Zionist Jews, by calling the later Palestinians in a racial slur, similar to how Black Americans used to be referred by the N word, suggesting that they are inferior human beings. This week Trump announced he was nominating Israeli-born Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi Yehuda Kaploun as US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. Chris Menahan from Information Liberation reports President Trump on Thursday announced he was nominating Israeli-born Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi Yehuda Kaploun as US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. I am proud to nominate Yehuda Kaploun as the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, Ambassador-at-Large, Trump said on Truth Social. Yehuda is a successful businessman, and staunch advocate for the Jewish Faith and the Rights of his people to live and worship free from persecution. With Anti-Semitism dangerously on the rise, Yehuda will be the strongest Representative for Americans and Jews across the Globe, and promote PEACE. Congratulations Yehuda! Kaploun, a prominent Miami-based businessman and longtime confidant of Trump, served as his Jewish outreach chief on Trumps vision for US-Israel relations after the 2024 election victory, the Jerusalem Post reports. Kaploun was born to a Chabad-Lubavitch family in Kfar Chabad, near Israels Ben-Gurion Airport. Kaploun initially got connected to Trump through Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. If confirmed, Kaploun would join an administration that has cited antisemitism in rolling out a range of new policies, including around canceling the visas of students involved in pro-Palestinian protests, freezing federal funding to colleges and universities and monitoring the social media feeds of immigrants, JTA noted.

One of the biggest misconceptions in American Christianity today is the false belief that the Book of Revelation prophesies that a world ruler will emerge during the Last Days who will be referred to as the Antichrist. However, this term, antichrist, does not appear anywhere in the Book of Revelation. The Apostle John did use this word in his writings, but NOT in the Book of Revelation. The term, also used in the plural antichrists, appears in Johns first two epistles. The word christ itself is from the Greek language that the New Testament part of the Bible was written in, and means anointed one, and is synonymous with the word messiah, which means the same thing, but from the Hebrew language. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, We have found the Messiah that is, the Christ. John 141 It was used as part of the name of Jesus, Jesus Christ, or Jesus the anointed one from God. Here are the totality of verses in the New Testament, written by John, that contain the word antichrist. Dear children, this is the last hour and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichristhe denies the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. And this is what he promised useven eternal life. I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeitjust as it has taught you, remain in him. 1 John 218-27 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood. 1 John 41-6 Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully. Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him. Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work. 2 John 17-11 As anyone who reads these words can plainly see, John is not talking about some world ruler who was going to come and declare himself to be the Antichrist in the last days. John clearly said that at the time he wrote these words, that the spirit of the antichrist was already in the world, and that there were already many antichrists among them. Satan, or the Devil, is the ultimate antichrist, and those who belong to him and are empowered by his spirit and deny that Jesus is the Messiah, are also antichrists. Who were these antichrists that John refers to? John wrote, as quoted above They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. John was a Jewish believer in Jesus he was NOT a Christian as that term was only used of Gentiles  non-Jewish believers in the New Testament, and assembled together with other believers in Jesus Christ. So when he writes they went out from us, these antichrists were other believers who claimed to believe that Jesus was the Messiah, but they were in fact antichrists. The Apostle Paul, in his writings in the New Testament, referred to these false believers who were part of the local fellowships as belonging to The Circumcision Party because even though they claimed to believe that Jesus was the Messiah, they wanted everyone to obey the Law of Moses and keep living in the Old Covenant, including circumcising male babies. They were the forerunners to todays Christian Zionists. As John describes these antichrists, he also equates them with false prophets. They claim to have the Spirit of Christ, but they are actually being led by the spirit of Satan. How can we distinguish between the true believers who are led by the Holy Spirit of Christ, and those who are led by the spirit of Satan and the spirit of this world? John is very clear about this in his writings as I quoted above But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood. Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. It really is not all that complicated. Who is lying, and who is telling the truth? Who believes that Jesus is the Messiah, and who does not? And if someone does claim that they believe in Jesus, like the Evangelical Christians, do they always tell the truth, or do they lie because they think they are better than everyone else and that therefore it is OK to lie to accomplish their purposes, because they are part of the chosen race? If you are born of the Spirit of Jesus, and know how to discern truth, then you can be reasonably sure that anyone who calls you antisemitic is probably an antichrist. This is what John said about how we should respond to them as I quoted above If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him. Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work. And these are the people now running our country, the antichrists. If you are labeled antisemitic as a result of your devotion and love for Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah who fulfilled all the Old Testament prophecies, then take courage, because Jesus is obviously the greatest antisemitic person to have ever walked on earth, so youre in good company!

"Title: CNN A Gender Reveal Sparked a Wildfire in California thats Burned More than 8,500 Acres
Description: One of the multiple wildfires burning in California was started by pyrotechnics released during a gender-reveal party, officials said.
Content: Select Page Posted by Erin Elizabeth  Sep 7, 2020  Animals, Environment, Health, News, U.S. Note from the Editor, Erin Elizabeth In recent years we have seen countless balloons released, even here near the ocean, which eventually end up harming or even killing marine life, and other stunts like this that are leaving animals and even humans dead. We suggest a good organic cake or clever way that doesnt harm the environment or those in it for a gender reveal. A smoke-generating pyrotechnic device used at a gender reveal party sparked the El Dorado Fire in San Bernardino County, according to a press release from Cal Fire. CBS Explosion at Gender Reveal Party Kills Woman in Iowa TIME PGE Admits It Might Be the Cause of Northern California Wildfire Despite Preventative Blackouts As of Monday, the fire has grown to 8,600 acres and is just 7 percent contained, according to the San Bernardino National Forest. Thanks to hot and dry weather, the El Dorado fire continued burning overnight. On Monday, the fire made a significant push downslope as it impacted structures in its path. More than 600 personnel have been deployed to the fire, along with 60 engines, six aircraft and six helicopters. The El Dorado fire is one of the multiple wildfires burning in California. Although no charges have been announced in the El Dorado fire to date, CNN and others explained that the people who held the gender reveal party that sparked this devastating fire can and most likely will be held financially and criminally responsible.

"Title: CNN Sea Turtles are Thriving as Coronavirus Lockdown Empties Florida Beaches
Description: In an important reminder that humans arent the only species here on earth, sea turtles are thriving right now while beaches are on lockdown
Content: Select Page Posted by Erin Elizabeth  Apr 19, 2020  Animals, Environment, Health, U.S. Fewer humans carelessly destroying their natural habitat has been a blessing for sea turtles in Florida. With many beaches closed in Florida during the coronavirus pandemic, researchers see less plastic and less waste. There are fewer people and vehicles on the beach projecting artificial light thus there is less disorientation for emerging hatchlings, according to David Godfrey, Executive Director for the Sea Turtle Conservancy. Because of these factors, sea turtles can build nests without any disruptions. Godfrey said that nesting season for leatherback turtles, the largest of all sea turtles, is underway right now, mostly in the central-east and southeast coast of Florida. They nest in fewer numbers than the loggerheads, who arrive in May. Later in the summer months is when green turtles will come. It takes approximately 60 days for sea turtle eggs to incubate and for hatchlings to emerge, Godfrey said. Many disturbing things can happen to their nests when humans take over their beaches. They trample and dig up the turtles nests and harm them with artificial light. CNN Sea turtles have been targeted multiple times this year in Florida. Another was just found with a spear in its neck Do You Pick Up Other Peoples Litter? You Should. With an inactive beach, the turtles can carry on the way nature intended. Godfrey said I think there is a strong likelihood that we will see decreased human-caused impacts on sea turtle nesting this year, which is a rare silver lining to this global pandemic. Its premature to try and use numbers to demonstrate what we all think and hope is happening. The numbers just arent there yet. I hear that the season is going pretty well so far, its off to a good start. Less foot traffic improves the reptiles situation right now, but what will happen when the beaches reopen, and the sea turtles eggs begin to hatch? Leatherback sea turtles will see hatchlings toward the end of April. Godfrey said researchers are working in uncharted territory, and only time will tell. Florida brewery unveils six-pack rings that feed sea turtles rather than kill them Dr. Justin Perrault, Director of Research at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center, said his team does worry that when the beaches reopen, there may be an influx of people flocking to the beach because they were stuck indoors for an extended period. He added It just depends on the behavior of people after the closures end. And if theres an excessive amount on the beaches, then more people means more interaction with turtles, which can be negative if they dont follow the rules. The city of Jacksonville announced beaches and parks in Duval County would open Friday with certain restrictions starting at 5 pm, according to the citys Twitter page. Perrault said when people do return, itll be essential for them to to keep lights off whenever possible, maintain distance from marine animals, and leave the beach the way they found it.

"Title: Dark Chocolate May Lower Diabetes Risk, While Milk Chocolate Adds Pounds
Description: Story at-a-glance Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the bodys ineffective use of insulin.

Content: Select Page Posted by Erin Elizabeth  Feb 15, 2025  Health Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the bodys ineffective use of insulin. This condition occurs when cells become resistant to insulin or when your pancreas fails to produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes leads to serious health complications. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes has been steadily increasing worldwide, posing a significant public health challenge. According to the latest Standards of Care in Diabetes  2024, published in Diabetes Care, the global burden of Type 2 diabetes continues to rise, driven by factors like sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits and genetic predisposition.1 Nearly 10.5 of the adult population is affected by Type 2 diabetes, with numbers projected to grow as obesity rates climb. In the U.S. alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that over 38 million people have diabetes, and approximately 90 to 95 of these cases are Type 2.2 The economic impact is substantial, with healthcare costs related to diabetes management and complications reaching billions annually. Furthermore, the mortality rate associated with Type 2 diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and neuropathy, underscores the need for effective prevention and management strategies. Fortunately, lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications involving dark chocolate, are often effective in managing and even reversing Type 2 diabetes. Beyond the immediate health risks, Type 2 diabetes significantly affects quality of life and daily functioning. Individuals with uncontrolled diabetes are at increased risk for severe complications, including heart attacks, strokes, vision loss and lower limb amputations. Additionally, the psychological burden of managing a chronic disease often leads to anxiety, depression and decreased overall well-being. Addressing Type 2 diabetes requires a comprehensive approach that not only focuses on medical treatment but also emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes and preventative measures to mitigate these extensive health risks. Type 2 diabetes is influenced by lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of physical activity and obesity. Conventional treatments often involve medications like metformin, which has side effects such as gastrointestinal issues. Further, most of these treatments focus on managing symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of the disease. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in the development of Type 2 diabetes, but environmental factors are equally important. A sedentary lifestyle and diets rich in processed foods, which contain excess linoleic acid LA in seed oils, contribute to insulin resistance. Since the mid-20th century, the consumption of LA, an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid found in most processed foods, has skyrocketed in Western diets. This dramatic increase coincides with the unprecedented rise in chronic metabolic diseases like obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. While LA is essential for maintaining healthy skin and other bodily functions, its overconsumption raises concerns about its role as a metabolic poison that interferes with mitochondrial function and disrupts glucose homeostasis and cellular energy production. Additionally, chronic stress and poor sleep patterns exacerbate the condition. The interplay between these factors creates a complex web that increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of Type 2 diabetes, occurs when cells in your body become less responsive to insulin. This resistance forces your pancreas to produce more insulin to maintain normal glucose levels, eventually leading to pancreatic exhaustion. Over time, this process results in elevated blood sugar levels, which cause damage to various organs and systems in your body. Diagnosing Type 2 diabetes is challenging due to its gradual onset and nonspecific symptoms. Many individuals remain undiagnosed until they experience significant health issues. Standard diagnostic tests, such as fasting blood glucose and HbA1c, dont always capture the early stages of insulin resistance, leading to delayed treatment and increased risk of complications. Using data from three prospective cohort studies, researchers explored how different types of chocolate consumption relate to the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The study focused on dark chocolate, milk chocolate and overall chocolate intake to determine their respective impacts on Type 2 diabetes risk and weight management.3 The study included a vast group of 192,208 participants from the Nurses Health Study, Nurses Health Study II and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Importantly, none of these individuals had Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer at the start of the research, ensuring that the findings specifically addressed the effects of chocolate consumption on those without pre-existing conditions.4 Findings revealed that consuming dark chocolate was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Participants who enjoyed five or more servings of dark chocolate each week experienced a 21 lower risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to those who consumed less.5 Additionally, for every serving of dark chocolate consumed weekly, there was a 3 decrease in Type 2 diabetes risk, highlighting a consistent protective effect.6 In contrast, milk chocolate did not show a similar benefit. The study found no significant link between milk chocolate intake and the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, regular consumption of milk chocolate was associated with weight gain over time, suggesting that while dark chocolate may offer health benefits, milk chocolate could contribute to unfavorable weight changes.7 The mechanisms behind dark chocolates protective effects are rooted in its rich cocoa content, particularly the presence of flavan-3-ols like epicatechin. These compounds enhance insulin sensitivity, allowing your body to manage blood sugar levels more effectively and thereby reducing the risk of insulin resistance.8 Interestingly, the study also noted that the benefits of dark chocolate consumption were more pronounced among younger individuals. This suggests that incorporating dark chocolate into the diet early on may offer more substantial protective effects against Type 2 diabetes.9 Furthermore, those who consumed dark chocolate tended to also eat other flavan-3-ol-rich foods and beverages, indicating that dark chocolate is often part of a broader, health-conscious dietary pattern.10 A scoping review explored the effects of cocoa polyphenols and dark chocolate on obesity, aiming to determine their role in weight management. This comprehensive review analyzed numerous research papers, highlighting the varied outcomes of cocoa consumption on obesity-related factors.11 The study focused on adults struggling with obesity, including those with additional health issues like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Researchers aimed to uncover whether the compounds found in cocoa could help manage weight and reduce inflammation in these individuals. While some research indicated that cocoa polyphenols could aid in weight management by boosting metabolism and reducing fat accumulation, other studies did not observe significant changes. This disparity suggests that the impact of cocoa on obesity depends on various factors, including the type of cocoa product consumed and the dosage used. Cocoa polyphenols, particularly flavanols like epicatechin and catechin, are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds are believed to enhance energy expenditure, which means your body burns more calories even at rest. Additionally, they may promote thermogenesis, a process where your body generates heat by burning calories, further supporting weight loss. However, the effectiveness of these mechanisms varies based on individual metabolism and the specific cocoa product consumed.12 The study also revealed variability in outcomes depending on the form and amount of cocoa consumed. Different cocoa products, such as dark chocolate, cocoa powder and supplements, contain varying levels of polyphenols. For instance, dark chocolate typically has a higher polyphenol content compared to milk chocolate, making it more effective in influencing weight-related factors. Moreover, the dosage of cocoa polyphenols plays a key role higher doses may lead to more significant benefits, but the optimal amount still requires further investigation.13 The review also emphasized the need for more research to fully understand how cocoa polyphenols contribute to weight control. While preliminary findings are promising, the exact pathways through which these compounds affect body weight and metabolism remain unclear. Future studies should aim to identify the most effective types and doses of cocoa polyphenols, as well as their long-term impact on obesity and related health conditions. Polyphenols in dark chocolate were linked to improved metabolic profiles, which include better blood sugar levels, reduced insulin resistance and optimized cholesterol levels. These improvements are particularly beneficial for individuals with obesity, as they are at a higher risk of developing metabolic disorders like diabetes and heart disease. By enhancing insulin sensitivity, cocoa polyphenols help your body utilize glucose more efficiently, preventing spikes in blood sugar levels that can lead to fat storage.14 The study also pointed out that most existing research has focused on obese individuals with other health conditions. There is a significant gap in understanding how cocoa polyphenols affect healthy obese individuals who do not have comorbidities. Studying this group could provide more insights into the standalone effects of cocoa on weight management and overall health, free from the influence of other diseases.15 Furthermore, the benefits of cocoa polyphenols extend beyond weight management. These compounds play a role in preventing chronic diseases by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which are common underlying factors in many health conditions. By protecting cells from damage and improving vascular function, cocoa polyphenols contribute to better long-term health outcomes.16 Despite the promising findings, the study highlighted several limitations in the current research. Many studies have small sample sizes or short intervention periods, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Additionally, the lack of standardization in cocoa product types and polyphenol dosages across studies adds to the inconsistency of results.17 Research published in the British Journal of Nutrition also investigated how dark chocolate rich in polyphenols affects important health indicators like blood sugar and blood pressure.18 The researchers wanted to see if consuming different amounts of these beneficial compounds makes a difference in managing these health markers, especially in individuals who are overweight or obese. The study included healthy, non-smoking adults between the ages of 19 and 50, all with a body mass index BMI of 25 or higher, indicating they were overweight or obese. Over the course of the research, participants consumed dark chocolate containing either 500 milligrams or 1,000 milligrams of polyphenols daily. The goal was to observe any changes in their fasting blood glucose levels, total cholesterol and blood pressure after two weeks of this diet. Findings revealed that both the 500 mg and 1000 mg polyphenol doses were effective in reducing fasting blood glucose and lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This means that the lower dose of polyphenols in dark chocolate was just as beneficial as the higher dose in terms of these specific health improvements. The rate of improvement was notably swift, with significant reductions in blood glucose and blood pressure observed after just two weeks of including dark chocolate in the participants diets. This quick response highlights the potential of dark chocolate as a dietary intervention for improving metabolic health markers in a relatively short period. After two weeks of the polyphenol-rich dark chocolate diet, no significant alterations were observed in total cholesterol levels or in the participants body measurements, such as weight or body fat percentage. In terms of biological mechanisms, the study suggests that the improvements in blood glucose and blood pressure are largely due to enhanced vascular function. Furthermore, the study points out a possible saturation effect with polyphenol doses. This means that once a certain amount of polyphenols is consumed, taking more does not necessarily lead to greater health benefits. Overall, the study highlights the significant role of polyphenol-rich dark chocolate in supporting metabolic health. By improving blood glucose and blood pressure levels, dark chocolate is a valuable addition to the diets of overweight and obese individuals looking to reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, as with any dietary change, its important to consume dark chocolate as part of a balanced diet to achieve the best health outcomes. Research now confirms that dark chocolate, when consumed properly, helps reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and improves insulin sensitivity. The key lies in understanding how to maximize its benefits while avoiding common pitfalls that could negate its positive effects. 1. Choose high-quality dark chocolate with at least 70 cacao and safe ingredients  Select dark chocolate rich in flavanols by opting for varieties with a minimum of 70 cacao. Ensure the chocolate is free from harmful substances such as cadmium and lead by choosing high-quality toxin-free brands. Avoid products containing vegetable oils and opt for brands that prioritize ingredient transparency and rigorous testing for heavy metals. Also look for brands that dont contain soy lecithin, high-fructose corn syrup or artificial flavors. 2. Incorporate dark chocolate into a carb-rich diet strategically  Integrate dark chocolate into a diet that includes 200 to 350 grams of targeted carbohydrates daily, adjusted based on individual microbiome needs and activity levels. 3 .Engage in regular physical activity and reduce LA  Eating dark chocolate is only part of a holistic approach to Type 2 diabetes. Regular physical activity is also important. Engage in activities like daily walking or other forms of exercise to improve insulin sensitivity and support blood vessel function, along with maintaining healthy blood pressure levels and overall metabolic health. Reducing your intake of LA in seed oils is also key to diabetes management. When you consume high levels of LA, your body produces more proinflammatory eicosanoids, which trigger chronic low-grade inflammation. This persistent inflammatory state interferes with insulin signaling pathways, making your cells less responsive to insulins effects. As a result, your body needs to produce more insulin to achieve the same glucose-lowering effect, leading to hyperinsulinemia. Over time, this compensatory mechanism exhausts your pancreatic beta-cells, reducing insulin production and exacerbating insulin resistance. Moreover, inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, which are elevated with increased LA intake, have been linked to higher risks of developing Type 2 diabetes.19 By fostering an inflammatory environment, excessive LA consumption not only disrupts your metabolic balance but also accelerates the progression toward diabetes. The primary reason why excess LA is harmful to your health is because it disrupts your cellular powerhouses  the mitochondria  disrupting cellular energy. Without energy, your cells cant repair and regenerate themselves, leading to chronic disease. 4. Monitor your metabolic health and adjust accordingly  Recognizing insulin resistance early is essential, as its a warning sign for your metabolic health  one that often precedes Type 2 diabetes. The HOMA-IR Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance is a valuable diagnostic tool that helps assess insulin resistance through a simple blood test. The HOMA-IR formula is as follows HOMA-IR  Fasting Glucose x Fasting Insulin  405, where Fasting glucose is measured in mgdL Fasting insulin is measured in μIUmL microinternational units per milliliter, and 405 is a constant that normalizes the values If youre using mmolL for glucose instead of mgdL, the formula changes slightly HOMA-IR  Fasting Glucose x Fasting Insulin  22.5, where Fasting glucose is measured in mmolL Fasting insulin is measured in μIUmL, and 22.5 is the normalizing factor for this unit of measurement Anything below 1.0 is considered a healthy HOMA-IR score. If youre above that, youre considered insulin-resistant. The higher your values, the greater your insulin resistance. Conversely the lower your HOMA-IR score, the less insulin resistance you have, assuming you are not a Type 1 diabetic who makes no insulin. ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED BY DR. JOSEPH MERCOLA.

"Title: Sleep Deprivation  A Hidden Threat to Public Health
Description: Story at-a-glance Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness characterized by symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and fatigue. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC estimates that influenza leads to between 9.3 and 41 million cases annually in the United States alone.1 This viral infection
Content: Select Page Posted by Erin Elizabeth  Jan 24, 2025  Health, Sleep Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness characterized by symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and fatigue. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC estimates that influenza leads to between 9.3 and 41 million cases annually in the United States alone.1 This viral infection could lead to severe health complications, especially in vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children and immunocompromised individuals. This is why understanding the factors that influence the spread and severity of influenza is essential. According to recent research, sleep deprivation plays a significant role in increasing your risk. A recent study published in medRxiv found that acute sleep deprivation is linked to a 54 increase in the risk of flu-related healthcare visits.2 This significant rise highlights the impact of sleep patterns on immune function and disease susceptibility. The researchers used data from Fitbit users between 2016 and 2022, and studied their sleep patterns, including their sleep estimates. They identified 32 different national events, both political and nonpolitical, wherein people were getting significantly less sleep than usual. These were dubbed as acute sleep deprivation events ASDEs. They found that after these ASDEs occurred, the participants risk of getting the flu significantly increased.3 In agreement with our hypothesis, the association of ASDEs with influenza visits was heightened in individuals with a greater number of short sleep genotypes OR  1.47 1.32, 1.64 vs. 1.10 0.98, 1.22, P-value of genotype-ASDE interaction  0.0008, Table S8-S10. Together, these findings suggest that population-level acute sleep deprivation and genetic predisposition jointly influence the risk of influenza-associated healthcare visits, the researchers concluded.4 This interplay between sleep deprivation and influenza risk suggests that factors disrupting sleep exacerbate the spread and severity of the flu, posing additional challenges for disease control and prevention. Sleep is essential for the regulation of various bodily functions, including the immune system. When sleep is disrupted, the production of cytokines, proteins that help fight infections, is reduced. This reduction weakens the immune response, making the body more vulnerable to infections like influenza. Additionally, sleep deprivation affects the bodys ability to produce antibodies, further compromising its ability to fend off viruses. The underlying causes of acute sleep deprivation are multifaceted. One major factor is the modern lifestyle, which often prioritizes productivity over rest. This societal pressure leads to irregular sleep patterns and insufficient sleep duration. Another contributing factor is the pervasive use of modern technology, which exposes individuals to blue light from screens, disrupting natural sleep cycles. Stress and anxiety, common in todays fast-paced world, further exacerbate sleep disturbances. Genetic predispositions also play a role, as some individuals are naturally inclined to shorter sleep durations, making them more susceptible to the effects of sleep deprivation. The complexity of sleep and its impact on health means that diagnosis sometimes falls short. Many healthcare providers do not fully recognize the significance of sleep patterns in relation to health outcomes. This oversight results in underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of conditions related to sleep deprivation. The featured video from The Diary of a CEO podcast features Dr. Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and one of the top experts on sleep science today. In this interview, Walker shares insights that will help revolutionize your understanding of sleep.5 Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body health  It is your life support system and as best we can tell I would argue its Mother Natures best effort yet at immortality, he says.6 The evolutionary significance of sleep cannot be overstated. Walker explains that sleep evolved alongside life itself on this planet, indicating its foundational role in biological processes.7 This long-standing presence in the natural world underscores sleeps essential function in sustaining life and facilitating growth. Walker states that insufficient sleep now carries a staggering economic burden, costing most nations billions of dollars annually. This massive financial toll underscores the importance of prioritizing adequate sleep within public health strategies and individual lifestyle choices.8 Insufficient sleep costs most nations about 2 of their gross domestic product GDP. So here in America, that number was 411 billion dollars of lost profit caused by insufficient sleep. In the United Kingdom, it was over 50 billion dollars. In Japan, it was over 120 billion dollars. Walker describes sleep as the tide that rises all the other health boats.9 By supporting various body functions, from metabolism to emotional regulation, sleep ensures that all aspects of your health are maintained optimally, making it a cornerstone of overall health and longevity. However, he estimates that one-third of the global population is now lacking the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep per night, which leads to a cascade of health issues that compromise your overall well-being. For example, sleep plays a crucial role in fortifying your immune system, making sure youre better equipped to fend off illnesses and will recover more swiftly when you do get sick. Sleep for example will restock the weaponry in your immune arsenal. It will make you a more immune sensitive individual, so youre more immune robust when you wake up, Walker said. When it comes to weight management, not getting enough sleep has significant consequences. Walker notes that if youre not getting sufficient sleep, 60 of all weight loss will come from lean muscle mass rather than fat.10 This means that lack of sleep not only hampers your ability to shed unwanted pounds but also compromises your muscle strength and overall metabolism. When you are dieting but you are under slept, you lose what you want to keep which is muscle, and you keep what you want to lose, which is fat. So again, its not an ideal situation, he explains. Walker also touched on the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive and emotional health, stressing that memory and learning are deeply intertwined with your sleep patterns. Sleep, upstairs within the brain, will fixate memories and help you learn and remember, he said.11 Knowledge and wisdom are deeply connected through sleep. While knowledge involves remembering individual pieces of information, wisdom is about understanding how these pieces fit together.12 Sleep facilitates this transformation, allowing you to integrate and apply what youve learned in meaningful ways. Emotional well-being is also greatly influenced by your sleep quality. Adequate sleep de-escalates anxiety and reduces emotional difficulties and traumas.13 By allowing your brain to process emotions effectively, sleep helps maintain mental stability and resilience against stressors. In the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, Walker says that sleep has a remarkable cleansing effect, as it helps remove Alzheimers toxic proteins that build up in the brain.14 This detoxification process is crucial in preventing the onset and progression of dementia-related conditions, highlighting sleeps role in long-term brain health. The two most feared diseases in developed nations are cancer and Alzheimers disease. Both of them have links to insufficient sleep, many of them causal. And this relationship between sleep and Alzheimers disease  Id probably say almost 50 of the work that I do at my sleep center is focused on sleep and Alzheimers disease. The data is stunning I would say at this stage insufficient sleep seems to be one of the most significant lifestyle factors that can develop or dictate the development of Alzheimers disease later in life. Now, thats a lifestyle factor. There are other genetic factors, but certainly we now know that insufficient sleep predicts a greater amount of Alzheimers pathology in your brain. Poor sleep negatively impacts every facet of your health, from cognitive performance to immune resilience. Fortunately, targeted lifestyle modifications that align with optimal cellular energy production and overall well-being will help significantly enhance your sleep quality. One of Walkers recommendations is to avoid lingering in bed in the morning within 30 minutes after you wake up, you should get out of your bed and go to a different room and do something relaxing, like stretching, meditating or even reading a book. The reason is because if you start to spend a lot of time awake in your bed, your brain is an incredibly associative device and very quickly it will start to learn that this thing called your bed is this place where Im always awake. Therefore, you start to learn through this repeated loop of behavior that Im always going to be wide awake in bed and we need to break that association, he explains. One of the strategies I recommend is getting at least 10 to 15 minutes of natural light first thing in the morning. Bright, blue light-rich morning sunlight signals to your body that its time to wake up. This will help send a strong message to your internal clock that day has arrived, making it less likely to be confused by weaker light signals later on. When it comes to having an efficient sleep routine, consistency is key. I recommend reading Top 33 Tips to Optimize Your Sleep Routine for a comprehensive list of strategies to get high-quality, restorative sleep at night, but to get you started, follow these four tips 1. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule  Establishing regular bedtimes and wake-up times each day helps synchronize your circadian rhythm naturally. Consistent sleep patterns enable your body to prepare for rest more efficiently, promoting deeper and more restorative sleep. Aim for seven to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep nightly. Chronic sleep deprivation or consistently getting less than six hours of sleep substantially elevates the risk of accidents, impaired decision-making and various health issues. 2. Optimize your sleep environment for cellular health  Create a bedroom that is completely dark, quiet, and cool, maintaining a temperature between 65 to 68 degrees F 18 to 20 degrees C. This supports the natural drop in body temperature that facilitates restful sleep. Eliminate all sources of artificial light, including LED screens and electronic devices, as even minimal light exposure disrupts melatonin production and interferes with your sleep cycle. Additionally, ensure your sleep area is free from environmental toxins by avoiding products containing vegetable oils, heavy metals and other harmful substances. Use natural, nontoxic bedding and minimize exposure to pollutants to foster an environment conducive to optimal cellular function and sleep quality. 3. Regulate carbohydrate and protein intake for restorative sleep  Your diet plays a crucial role in sleep quality. Consume 250 to 300 grams of carbohydrates daily, adjusting based on your microbiome and activity level, to support cellular energy production and metabolic health. Ensure that approximately 15 of your calorie intake comes from protein, prioritizing 0.8 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass. Incorporate collagen-rich protein sources to aid in metabolic processes and support overall health. Avoid high-fiber diets and eliminate foods like pasteurized dairy products, processed snacks and ultraprocessed foods. This approach helps maintain gut health and reduces endotoxin levels, thereby positively impacting your sleep. 4. Support mitochondrial function with supplements  Develop a calming evening routine two to three hours before bedtime by reducing both mental and physical activities. Engage in soothing practices such as light stretching, reading or gentle movements to signal to your body that its time to prepare for rest. Avoid stimulating activities, heavy meals and intense exercise during this period. Incorporate pharmaceutical-grade methylene blue, only as prescribed by a healthcare professional, to support mitochondrial function and reduce reductive stress. The recommended dosage is 5 milligrams once daily, sourced exclusively from a compounding pharmacy. Additionally, consider grounding practices in uncontaminated environments, such as the ocean, to alleviate stress and enhance relaxation. This structured wind-down routine helps transition your brain from active engagement to a state of restful sleep, ensuring higher quality and more restorative rest. ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED BY DR.
